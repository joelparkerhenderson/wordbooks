# Code of conduct

A code of conduct is a set of guidelines that outlines the standards of behavior and ethical principles that individuals or organizations are expected to follow. It helps ensure that everyone involved is aware of their responsibilities. A code of conduct can apply to a range of different areas, such as workplace behavior, professional conduct, or community standards.

A code of conduct typically includes:

* Core values and principles: A code of conduct often begins with a statement of the core values and ethical principles that the organization or community is committed to upholding. These might include honesty, integrity, respect, and fairness.

* Prohibited conduct: The code of conduct should clearly identify the behaviors that are not acceptable within the organization or community. This might include harassment, discrimination, dishonesty, or other forms of misconduct.

* Reporting, accountability, and dispute resolution: The code of conduct should include guidelines for reporting and addressing violations of the code. This might include information on who to report to, how to make a report, and the consequences for violating the code.

* Training and education: To ensure that everyone within the organization or community is aware of the code of conduct and understands their responsibilities, it may be necessary to provide training and education on the code.

* Ongoing review and updates: A code of conduct should be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains relevant and effective in guiding behavior and decision-making.

By establishing clear expectations for behavior, and promoting accountability and responsibility, a code of conduct can help promote a positive and productive environment for all.
