# Guerilla marketing

Guerilla marketing is an advertising strategy that involves creative, unconventional, and low-cost tactics to promote a product, service, or brand. The term "guerrilla" implies the use of tactics that are unexpected, unconventional, and often ambush-style in nature.

Unlike traditional marketing techniques that rely on paid advertising, guerilla marketing aims to generate buzz and create a memorable impression among the target audience using non-traditional means. It is often associated with smaller businesses and startups that don't have large marketing budgets and are looking for creative ways to promote their brand.

Some common examples of guerilla marketing include:

* Stunts or events: Creating a memorable event or spectacle to draw attention to a brand or product.

* Ambush marketing: Associating a brand with a popular event or trend, even if the brand is not officially sponsoring it.

* Street art or graffiti: Using public spaces to create artistic and provocative displays that promote a brand or product.

* Viral marketing: Creating online content that is designed to be shared widely and generate buzz around a brand or product.

* Product sampling: Offering free samples of a product to potential customers to generate interest and word-of-mouth.

Guerilla marketing can be highly effective when done correctly, as it has the potential to generate buzz, create a memorable impression, and generate word-of-mouth. However, it can also be risky, as some tactics may be seen as intrusive or offensive if not executed carefully.
