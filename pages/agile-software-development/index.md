# Agile software development

Agile software development is a methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. It was created as a response to the limitations of traditional software development methodologies, such as the Waterfall model, which were often inflexible and did not allow for changes in requirements or customer needs.

Here are the key principles of Agile software development:

1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: Agile development puts a strong emphasis on collaboration with the customer, rather than trying to negotiate a fixed contract upfront. This allows for more flexibility and responsiveness to changing customer needs.

2. Responding to change over following a plan: In Agile development, the team is encouraged to respond to changes in requirements or priorities rather than following a rigid plan. This allows for greater adaptability to changing circumstances.

3. Working software over comprehensive documentation: Agile development values working software over extensive documentation. The focus is on delivering functional software in shorter development cycles, rather than creating extensive documentation upfront.

4. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: Agile development prioritizes the interactions between team members, rather than following rigid processes and tools. This encourages greater collaboration and communication within the team.

5. Embracing change: Agile development embraces change as a natural part of the development process. It recognizes that requirements and priorities may change over time and adapts to these changes.
