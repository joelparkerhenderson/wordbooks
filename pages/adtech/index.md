# Adtech (Advertising technology)

Adtech, short for advertising technology, refers to the use of software and other tools to automate and optimize the processes involved in digital advertising. This includes activities such as ad creation, targeting, delivery, tracking, and measurement. The goal of adtech is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of advertising campaigns, while also reducing costs and improving ROI.

* Demand-side platforms (DSPs) allow advertisers to buy ad inventory across multiple ad exchanges and supply-side platforms (SSPs) in real-time. DSPs use sophisticated algorithms to evaluate ad inventory and target audiences based on factors such as demographics, location, behavior, and device.

* Supply-side platforms (SSPs) allow publishers to sell ad inventory across multiple ad exchanges and DSPs in real-time. SSPs use sophisticated algorithms to evaluate ad inventory and maximize revenue by optimizing the price and placement of ads.

* Ad exchanges are online marketplaces that connect advertisers and publishers, allowing them to buy and sell ad inventory in real-time. Ad exchanges match ads with the most relevant audiences and ensure that ads are delivered at the right time and in the right format.

* Ad servers are software platforms that serve and manage ads, delivering them to users' devices and tracking their performance. Ad servers can optimize ad delivery and ensure that ads are displayed correctly and consistently across different devices and platforms.

* Data management platforms (DMPs) help advertisers and publishers collect, analyze, and manage data related to their advertising campaigns, and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns over time.
