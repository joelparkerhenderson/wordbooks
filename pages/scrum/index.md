# Scrum

Scrum is a widely used software development framework that aims to improve productivity, reduce time to market, and promote teamwork. Scrum relies on self-organizing and cross-functional teams that work in short cycles called "sprints", such as 1-4 weeks, resulting in a shippable product. Scrum emphasizes teamwork, communication, and continuous improvement.

Scrum roles:

* Product Owner: Define and prioritize the features of the product; build and maintain the product backlog; ensure stakeholders understand the product vision and goals.

* Scrum Master: Ensure that Scrum is properly implemented and followed; facilitate team meetings; help the team identify and overcome obstacles.

* Development Team: Design, build, and test the product.

Scrum artifacts:

* Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features, requirements, and changes that the product needs to deliver.

* Sprint Backlog: A list of tasks that the team has committed to completing during a sprint.

* Increment: A list of all the completed Product Backlog items at the end of a sprint. It must be a potentially shippable product that meets the Definition of Done.

Scrum events:

* A sprint starts with a planning meeting defines the sprint's goal and its tasks.

* A daily scrum meeting keeps the team members aligned, identify any obstacles, and adjust the Sprint Backlog if necessary.

* A sprint ends with a review meeting to show the work to stakeholders for feedback, and a retrospectiveive meeting to identify areas for improvement.

Scrum provides a structured approach to software development that helps teams deliver high-quality software products quickly and efficiently. However, it requires commitment and discipline from all team members to be successful.
