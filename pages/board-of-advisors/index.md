# Board of advisors (BOA)

A board of advisors (BOA) is a group of individuals who provide guidance and support to a company or organization. Unlike a board of directors (BOD), which has legal and fiduciary responsibilities, a board of advisors is an informal group that provides non-binding advice and expertise.

The primary purpose of a board of advisors is to provide strategic guidance and direction to the company's management team. Members of the board may have expertise in areas such as finance, marketing, technology, or industry-specific knowledge. They may also have connections and relationships that can be leveraged to help the company achieve its goals.

Some of the key benefits of having a board of advisors include:

* Access to expertise: By tapping into the knowledge and experience of the board members, the company can benefit from their expertise and insights.

* Objective advice: Because the board of advisors is not bound by legal or fiduciary responsibilities, they can provide unbiased and objective advice that is focused on the best interests of the company.

* Networking opportunities: Board members may have connections and relationships that can help the company build partnerships, secure funding, or attract new customers.

* Credibility: Having a board of advisors can enhance the company's credibility with investors, customers, and other stakeholders.

It's important to note that a board of advisors is not a substitute for a board of directors. While the board of advisors can provide valuable guidance and support, the board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management team and ensuring that the company is operating in accordance with legal and ethical standards.
