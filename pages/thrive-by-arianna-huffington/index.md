# “Thrive” by Arianna Huffington

“Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder” is a book written by Arianna Huffington, co-founder and former editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post. In the book, Huffington discusses her personal experience with burnout and the importance of redefining success beyond just money and power, by incorporating well-being, wisdom, and wonder into our lives.

Huffington starts by describing her own experience with burnout, which led her to collapse from exhaustion and wake up with a broken cheekbone and a cut over her eye. This incident led her to reassess her priorities and redefine success in a more holistic way, beyond just financial and professional success.

The book then explores the idea of the "Third Metric" of success, which includes well-being, wisdom, and wonder. Huffington argues that these metrics are essential for a fulfilling and sustainable life, and that they should be incorporated into our personal and professional goals.

The book includes research and examples from various fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and business, to support the importance of these metrics. Huffington also shares practical tips and advice for incorporating these metrics into our daily lives, including meditation, sleep, and disconnecting from technology.

Throughout the book, Huffington emphasizes the importance of community and connection, and the role they play in our well-being and happiness. She encourages readers to build strong relationships and support systems, and to prioritize time for self-care and personal growth.
