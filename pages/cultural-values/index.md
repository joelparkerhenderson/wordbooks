# Cultural values

Cultural values are principles and beliefs that guide the behavior, decision-making, and interactions within a particular culture or organization. Cultural values can shape everything from individual behavior to organizational strategy and can help to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.

There are many different cultural values frameworks that have been developed over the years, each with their own unique approach to understanding and analyzing cultural values. Some of the most well-known frameworks include:

* Hofstede's cultural dimensions: Developed by social psychologist Geert Hofstede, this framework looks at cultural values across six dimensions: power distance, individualism vs collectivism, masculinity vs femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term vs short-term orientation, and indulgence vs restraint.

* The Trompenaars' model: This framework looks at cultural values across seven dimensions: universalism vs particularism, individualism vs communitarianism, specific vs diffuse, neutral vs emotional, achievement vs ascription, time as sequence vs time as synchronization, and internal direction vs outer direction.

* The Schwartz Value Theory: Developed by psychologist Shalom Schwartz, this framework looks at cultural values across ten dimensions: power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security.

These frameworks can be useful for understanding cultural differences, identifying areas of potential conflict, and developing effective strategies for cross-cultural communication and collaboration. However, it's important to remember that cultural values are complex and multifaceted, and that individuals and organizations may prioritize different values in different contexts. It's also important to approach cultural values with sensitivity and respect, avoiding stereotypes and assumptions about people based on their cultural background.
