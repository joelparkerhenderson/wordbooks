# Full Ratchet

Full Ratchet is a provision in venture capital that is designed to protect investors from dilution. This provision is typically included in the terms of a company's preferred stock. Essentially, the full ratchet provision ensures that if a company issues new shares of stock at a lower price than previous rounds, the existing investors' shares will be repriced to the lower valuation, as if they had been issued at that price originally.

For example, let's say a company raises its first round of funding at a $10 million valuation and issues 1 million shares to investors at $10 per share. Later on, the company raises its second round of funding at a $5 million valuation and issues 2 million shares to investors at $2.50 per share. If the full ratchet provision is included in the terms of the preferred stock, the investors in the first round will receive 1.6 million shares at $2.50 per share, which is the same valuation as the second round. This means the first round investors' shares are now worth half of what they were before the second round, but they still own the same percentage of the company.

Full ratchet is often viewed as a more investor-friendly provision than its counterpart, the weighted-average anti-dilution provision. While full ratchet provides more protection against dilution, it can also be more punitive to the company's founders and other early investors if the company's valuation declines significantly in later rounds. As a result, many venture capital firms will negotiate to include a weighted-average anti-dilution provision in the preferred stock terms, which provides some protection to investors while also being more founder-friendly.
