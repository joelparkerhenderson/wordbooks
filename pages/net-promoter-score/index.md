# Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric used by businesses to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction. NPS asks the question "How likely are you to recommend our product/service to a friend or colleague?", with a scale of 0-10, with 0 being "not at all likely" and 10 being "extremely likely".

Based on their response, customers are grouped into three categories:

* Promoters (score 9-10): These customers are highly satisfied and are likely to recommend the product/service to others. They are the most valuable customers for the business as they are more likely to make repeat purchases and promote the brand to others.

* Passives (score 7-8): These customers are satisfied but not enthusiastic about the product/service. They are less likely to recommend the brand and are more likely to switch to a competitor.

* Detractors (score 0-6): These customers are dissatisfied and unlikely to recommend the product/service to others. They are the least valuable customers for the business and can harm the brand through negative word-of-mouth.

The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. The score can range from -100 to +100, with a higher score indicating a higher level of customer satisfaction and loyalty.

NPS can provide valuable insights for businesses in terms of understanding their customers' satisfaction levels and identifying areas for improvement. It can be used to track changes in customer loyalty over time and to benchmark against industry competitors.

While NPS can be a useful tool, it should not be relied on as the sole measure of customer satisfaction, as it has limitations and may not provide a complete picture of customer experience. It is important to supplement NPS with other metrics and qualitative feedback to gain a more comprehensive understanding of customer satisfaction and loyalty.
