# Peer-to-peer (P2P)

Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a decentralized network architecture in which participants in the network share resources and computing power directly with each other, without the need for a centralized server or intermediary. This approach allows for more efficient use of resources and greater scalability than traditional client-server models.

In a P2P network, each node in the network can act as both a client and a server, allowing for direct communication and sharing of resources such as files, data, and computing power. This differs from client-server architectures, where clients request services or resources from a central server, which then provides them.

P2P networks are commonly used for file sharing, content distribution, and distributed computing applications. Examples of P2P networks include BitTorrent, Napster, and Bitcoin.

One of the key benefits of P2P networks is their resilience to failure. Because there is no single point of failure, the network can continue to operate even if some nodes go offline or are attacked. However, this same resilience can also make it difficult to regulate and monitor P2P networks, leading to concerns about piracy, malware distribution, and other illegal activities.

Overall, P2P networks have had a significant impact on the development of decentralized technologies and distributed computing, and continue to be an area of active research and innovation.
