# Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)

Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is a measure of employee loyalty and engagement in a company. It is based on the Net Promoter Score (NPS) model, which was developed by Fred Reichheld, a business strategist and author.

eNPS is calculated based on a single question survey that asks employees how likely they are to recommend the company as a place to work to their friends or colleagues. Respondents rate their likelihood of recommending on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being "not at all likely" and 10 being "extremely likely."

Employees who give a rating of 9 or 10 are considered promoters, those who give a rating of 7 or 8 are considered passive, and those who give a rating of 0 to 6 are considered detractors.

To calculate eNPS, the percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters. The score can range from -100 to 100, with a higher score indicating a more engaged and loyal workforce. A score above zero is considered good, while a score above 50 is excellent.

eNPS is a useful tool for companies to measure employee satisfaction and engagement, and to identify areas for improvement in the workplace. It can also be used to compare the company's performance with other companies in the same industry.
