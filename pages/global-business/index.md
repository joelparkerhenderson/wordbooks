# Global business

Global business refers to the economic activities and operations conducted by companies across national borders and in multiple countries. It involves the exchange of goods, services, and resources between nations, as well as the establishment and management of international business operations. Global business encompasses a wide range of activities, including trade, investment, outsourcing, supply chain management, and international expansion.

Key drivers include:

* Technological Advancements: Advances in transportation, communication, and information technologies have greatly facilitated global business operations. Companies can now transport goods more efficiently, communicate instantaneously across borders, and access information on global markets and opportunities.

* Market Liberalization: The reduction of trade barriers, the signing of free trade agreements, and the liberalization of markets have opened up opportunities for companies to expand their operations globally. This has led to increased trade flows and the globalization of supply chains.

* Access to Resources and Talent: Global business allows companies to access resources, such as raw materials, capital, and skilled labor, that may be scarce or more cost-effective in other countries. It enables businesses to tap into a diverse pool of talent, expertise, and innovation from around the world.

* Economies of Scale and Scope: Operating globally often provides companies with economies of scale and scope. By accessing larger markets and spreading fixed costs over a wider customer base, businesses can achieve cost efficiencies and increased profitability.

Challenges and considerations include cultural differences, legal and regulatory compliance, currency and exchange rate risk, and logistics and supply chain management (SCM) both intra-country and inter-country.
