# Pricing models

Pricing models refer to the various strategies and approaches that businesses use to determine the prices of their products or services. Pricing is a critical aspect of business strategy, as it directly affects marketability, revenue, and profitability. Here are some common pricing models used by businesses:

* Cost-plus pricing. Calculate the total cost of producing a product or service, then add a markup, typically a percentage of the total cost. This ensures that the business makes a profit on each sale.

* Value-based pricing. Set the price based on what the customer is willing to pay for the product or service, rather than on the cost of producing it. Value-based pricing is commonly used for premium or luxury products.

* Dynamic pricing. Adjust prices based on changes in demand and supply. For example, prices for airline tickets and hotel rooms often change depending on the time, date, and season.

* Subscription pricing. Charge a recurring fee in exchange for access to a product or service. Subscription pricing is commonly used for software, media, and other digital products.

* Bundled pricing. Offer multiple products or services together at a discounted price. The goal is to encourage customers to purchase more products or services than they might otherwise.

* Freemium pricing. Offer a basic version of a product or service for free, and charge for more features. The goal is to attract a users with the free version, then convert some users into paying customers.

* Pay-what-you-want (PWYW) pricing. Allows customers to set their own price. The goal is to encourage customers to pay what they believe the product or service is worth, and to attract customers who might not otherwise purchase the product or service.
