# Economic moat

An economic moat describes a company's competitive advantage over its competitors. The term "moat" comes from a moat surrounding a castle to keep out intruders. An economic moat protects a company's market share, profitability, and growth prospects from external threats.

There are a variety of economic moats:

* Brand Moat. Companies with strong brands can charge premium prices, and customers are often willing to pay more because they perceive the brand as being superior.

* Network Moat. Companies with large strong networks have advantages. For example, social media companies can create a network moat because their value increases as more people join the platform.

* Cost Moat. Companies can have a significant cost advantage over competitors. For example, due to economies of scale, proprietary technology, efficiency capabilties, or a unique business model.

* Switching Moat. A switching moat is when customers can't, or won't, switch from one company's product or service to another. This could be because of contractual relationships, or data ownership, or because of customer loyalty.

* Regulatory Moat. This is when a company has a competitive advantage due to regulations. This could be because of the company has licenses or permits that are difficult for competitors to obtain, or because the company has expertise in navigating complex regulatory environments.

Companies with strong economic moats are often able to generate above-average returns on capital and sustain their competitive advantage over the long term. As a result, investors often look for companies with strong economic moats as they are viewed as less risky investments with higher potential for long-term growth.
