# Economic moat

An economic moat is a term used to describe a company's competitive advantage over its competitors. The term "moat" is borrowed from the idea of a moat surrounding a castle, which acts as a barrier to keep out unwanted intruders. Similarly, an economic moat helps to protect a company's market share, profitability, and growth prospects from external threats.

There are several types of economic moats that a company can possess:

* Brand Moat. Companies with strong brands can charge premium prices for their products or services, and customers are often willing to pay more because they perceive the brand as being superior.

* Network Moat. Companies with large strong networks have advantages. For example, social media companies like Facebook and LinkedIn have a network moat because their value increases as more people join the platform.

* Cost Moat. This is when a company has a significant cost advantage over its competitors. This could be due to economies of scale, proprietary technology, efficiency capabilties, or a unique business model.

* Switching Moat. A switching moat is created when it is difficult or costly for customers to switch from one company's product or service to another. This could be because of contractual relationships, or data ownership, or because of customer loyalty.

* Regulatory Moat. This is when a company has a competitive advantage due to government regulations. This could be because of exclusive licenses or permits that are difficult for competitors to obtain, or because of expertise in navigating complex regulatory environments.

Companies with strong economic moats are often able to generate above-average returns on capital and sustain their competitive advantage over the long term. As a result, investors often look for companies with strong economic moats as they are viewed as less risky investments with higher potential for long-term growth.
