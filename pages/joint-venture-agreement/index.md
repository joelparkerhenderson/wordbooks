# Joint venture agreement (JVA)

A joint venture agreement (JVA) is a legal agreement between two or more parties who agree to work together on a specific business project or activity. It is a way for companies to pool their resources and expertise to achieve a common goal.

The agreement typically includes provisions that:

* Define the purpose of the joint venture: This outlines the reason for the parties to come together and establish the joint venture.

* Specify the parties involved: This includes the parties who are forming the joint venture, their roles and responsibilities, and their contributions to the joint venture.

* Establish the financial arrangements: This outlines how the profits and losses will be shared between the parties.

* Define the management and control: This outlines how the joint venture will be managed and controlled, including the decision-making process and the roles and responsibilities of each party.

* Specify the term of the agreement: This outlines how long the joint venture will be in effect.

* Establish the consequences of termination: This outlines what will happen if the joint venture is terminated early, including any damages or penalties that may be imposed.

Joint venture agreements are commonly used in international business transactions, where companies from different countries may partner to expand into new markets. They can also be used in domestic settings, such as when two companies in the same industry join forces to develop a new product or service.
