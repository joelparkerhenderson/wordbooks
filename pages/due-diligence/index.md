# Due diligence

Due diligence is a comprehensive investigation conducted by an interested party before entering into a business transaction. It involves an examination of the financial, legal, operational, and other aspects of a company to assess benefits and risks. The goal is to provide the interested party with all the relevant information needed to make an informed decision regarding the transaction.

Typical areas:

* Financial Due Diligence: Review the target company's financial records, including its financial statements, tax returns, and other relevant financial data. The objective is to ensure that the financial information provided by the target company is accurate and that the company has a sound financial position.

* Legal Due Diligence: Review the target company's legal documents, including contracts, licenses, permits, and regulatory filings. The objective is to identify any potential legal issues or liabilities that could impact the transaction or investment.

* Operational Due Diligence: Review the target company's operations, including its business model, supply chain, and production processes. The objective is to identify any operational risks or inefficiencies that could impact the target company's performance.

* Commercial Due Diligence: Review the target company's market and industry dynamics, including competition, customer demand, and trends. The objective is to assess the target company's market position and potential growth opportunities.

Due diligence may also involve interviews with key stakeholders, site visits, and other investigative activities. The findings of the due diligence process are typically summarized in a report that provides the interested party with an overview of the target company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT).
