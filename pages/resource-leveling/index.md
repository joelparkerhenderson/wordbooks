# Resource leveling

Resource leveling is a project management technique that involves adjusting the project schedule to optimize the use of available resources while keeping the project on track. It involves managing and balancing the workload of project resources, such as people, equipment, and materials, so that no one is overburdened or idle.

The goal of resource leveling is to ensure that resources are used efficiently and effectively, and that the project is completed on time and within budget. To achieve this, project managers typically use resource leveling software to visualize the project schedule and allocate resources based on their availability and the project requirements.

Resource leveling involves several steps, including:

* Identifying the available resources: Project managers need to identify the resources available for the project, including their skill sets, availability, and working hours.

* Developing a resource plan: Based on the project requirements and resource availability, project managers develop a resource plan that outlines how each resource will be used throughout the project.

* Creating a project schedule: Once the resource plan is developed, project managers create a project schedule that includes all the project activities and the resources required for each activity.

* Identifying resource conflicts: Project managers use resource leveling software to identify any resource conflicts, such as overallocation or underallocation, that may affect the project schedule.

* Resolving resource conflicts: To resolve resource conflicts, project managers can adjust the project schedule by delaying activities, adding resources, or reducing the scope of the project.

* Monitoring the project progress: Project managers continually monitor the project progress to ensure that the project is on track and that resources are being used efficiently.

Resource leveling is an essential technique for project managers who need to manage complex projects with limited resources. It helps ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently, which can help increase project success rates and reduce the risk of project failure.
