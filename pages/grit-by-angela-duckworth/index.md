# “Grit” by Angela Duckworth

"Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance" is a book by psychologist Angela Duckworth, which explores the concept of grit and how it relates to success in various domains.

The central thesis of the book is that grit, defined as a combination of passion and perseverance towards long-term goals, is a crucial factor in achieving success in any pursuit. Duckworth argues that while talent and intelligence are important, they are not the only factors that determine success. Rather, it is the ability to persist in the face of obstacles and setbacks that sets successful people apart.

Duckworth draws on a wide range of research, including her own studies of West Point cadets, National Spelling Bee contestants, and salespeople, to show how grit is related to achievement in diverse fields. She also discusses the importance of cultivating grit in children, and provides practical advice on how to develop grit in oneself and others.

Throughout the book, Duckworth challenges common assumptions about talent, effort, and success, and provides a compelling case for the power of grit in achieving one's goals. Ultimately, "Grit" is a thought-provoking and inspiring read that offers valuable insights for anyone striving to achieve success in their own life.
