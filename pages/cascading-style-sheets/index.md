# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, is a programming language used for describing the visual presentation of a web document written in HTML or XML. It provides a set of rules and guidelines for specifying how elements within a web page should be displayed, including their layout, color, font, and other visual properties.

CSS works by separating the presentation of a web page from its structure and content. Instead of directly embedding styling information within the HTML markup, CSS allows developers to define styles in a separate CSS file, or directly within the HTML document itself using the "style" tag. This separation of concerns enhances the maintainability, flexibility, and reusability of web pages.

CSS operates on a cascading principle, meaning that multiple style rules can be applied to the same element, and the browser determines how to prioritize and apply these rules based on specificity, inheritance, and the order of declaration.

Selectors are a fundamental part of CSS. They are used to target specific HTML elements or groups of elements to which a particular style rule should be applied. Selectors can target elements by their tag name, class, ID, attribute, or their position within the document structure. For example, to select all paragraphs within a web page, you can use the selector p.

Once the target elements are selected, CSS properties are used to define their visual appearance. Properties include attributes such as color, font-size, margin, padding, background-color, border, and many others. By assigning values to these properties, developers can control the dimensions, positioning, typography, colors, and other visual aspects of the selected elements.

CSS also supports various advanced features and techniques, including media queries for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, transitions and animations for adding dynamic effects, and the ability to import external style sheets for modularization and reusability.

With CSS, web developers have extensive control over the presentation and layout of web pages. By separating style from structure, CSS promotes consistency, maintainability, and scalability, enabling the creation of visually appealing and user-friendly websites across different platforms and devices.
