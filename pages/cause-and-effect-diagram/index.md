# Cause-and-effect diagrams

Cause-and-effect diagrams, also known as Ishikawa diagrams or fishbone diagrams, are visual tools used to analyze and solve problems. They were developed by Japanese quality control expert Kaoru Ishikawa in the 1960s and are often used in manufacturing, engineering, and quality management.

The cause-and-effect diagram is a structured tool that helps to identify the possible causes of a particular problem or event. It is based on the idea that there are multiple factors that contribute to a problem and that by identifying and addressing these factors, the problem can be solved. The diagram is shaped like a fishbone, with the problem statement or effect placed at the head of the fish, and the potential causes branching out along the spine.

There are six main categories of causes that are commonly used in cause-and-effect diagrams, which are often remembered by the acronym "6 Ms":

* Manpower (people)

* Methods (processes)

* Machines (equipment)

* Materials

* Measurements (data)

* Environment (physical conditions)

The diagramming process involves brainstorming the possible causes of the problem and organizing them into these categories. This is typically done in a group setting, with a team of people who have knowledge and experience related to the problem. Once the possible causes are identified, they can be analyzed and prioritized, and potential solutions can be developed and implemented.

Cause-and-effect diagrams are particularly useful for identifying the root causes of a problem, rather than just treating the symptoms. They are also helpful in promoting teamwork and collaboration, as they allow different perspectives and areas of expertise to be brought together in a structured way.
