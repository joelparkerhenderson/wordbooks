# Class diagram

A class diagram is a type of static structure diagram that represents the structure of a system in terms of its classes and their relationships. It is used to describe the objects, attributes, methods, and relationships within a system, and to provide a visual representation of the system's structure.

The main components of a class diagram are as follows:

* Classes: A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects in a system. It defines the attributes and methods of the objects and provides a structure for organizing the data and behavior of the system. Classes are represented as rectangles with the class name at the top.

* Objects: An object is an instance of a class in a system. It represents a specific entity within the system and has its own set of attributes and methods. Objects are represented as rectangles with the object name at the top.

* Attributes: Attributes are the properties of an object that describe its state. They represent the data that an object contains and define the characteristics of the object. Attributes are represented as ovals attached to the class or object.

* Methods: Methods are the behaviors of an object that define what it can do. They represent the operations that an object can perform and define how it interacts with other objects. Methods are represented as rectangles attached to the class or object.

* Relationships: Relationships represent the connections between classes and objects in a system. The most common relationships in a class diagram are association, aggregation, and composition.

* Association: a relationship between two classes in which one class uses or relies on the other class; it is represented by a line connecting the two classes.

* Aggregation: a "has-a" relationship between two classes in which one class is composed of or contains the other class. It is represented by a diamond-shaped arrowhead.

* Composition: a strong "has-a" relationship between two classes in which one class owns or controls the other class. It is represented by a filled diamond-shaped arrowhead.

A class diagram can be used for different purposes, such as:

* System design: Class diagrams can be used to design the system's architecture and to identify the system's components and their relationships.

* Code generation: Class diagrams can be used to generate code for the system.

* Documentation: Class diagrams can be used to document the system's structure and relationships.
