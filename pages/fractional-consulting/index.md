# Fractional consulting

Fractional consulting is a type of consulting arrangement where an experienced consultant provides their services to a company on a part-time or project basis, rather than working full-time or being hired permanently. This allows companies to gain access to high-level expertise and specialized knowledge without having to pay the full cost of hiring a full-time executive.

Examples:

* A Fractional Chief Technology Officer (CTO) helps companies with their technology strategy, product development, and technology infrastructure. They work closely with the company's leadership team to identify technology trends and opportunities, evaluate technology vendors, and ensure that the company's technology is aligned with its business objectives.

* A Fractional Chief Legal Officer (CLO) helps with legal advice, such as contracts, compliance, and intellectual property.

* A Fractional Chief Financial Officer (CFO) helps with accounting, budgeting, forecasting, cash flow, and fundraising.

Fractional consulting can be a cost-effective way for companies to access high-level expertise without the overhead costs associated with hiring a full-time executive. Fractional consultants typically work remotely, which also helps to reduce costs associated with office space and other expenses.

Fractional consulting can be an attractive option for startups and small businesses that may not have the resources to hire a full-time executive or maintain a large in-house team. However, it's important for companies to carefully evaluate the qualifications and experience of fractional consultants to ensure that they have the necessary expertise to provide value to the company.
