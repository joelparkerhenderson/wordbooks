# Triple bottom line (TBL)

Triple bottom line (TBL) is a business framework that takes into account three aspects of performance: social, environmental, and financial. The idea behind TBL is that a business should not only focus on maximizing profits but also on creating positive social and environmental impact. The three bottom lines represent the three areas of focus: people, planet, and profit.

The TBL concept was first introduced by John Elkington in 1994 in his book "Cannibals with Forks: The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business." The idea gained popularity in the following years and has been adopted by many organizations as a way to measure their success and impact beyond financial metrics.

The social bottom line of the TBL framework focuses on a business's impact on people. This includes factors such as employee well-being, customer satisfaction, community involvement, and social justice. Businesses that prioritize their social bottom line aim to create a positive impact on society and the communities they serve.

The environmental bottom line focuses on a business's impact on the planet. This includes factors such as energy and resource consumption, waste management, and carbon emissions. Businesses that prioritize their environmental bottom line aim to reduce their environmental impact and promote sustainability.

The financial bottom line focuses on a business's profitability and financial success. This includes factors such as revenue, profits, and return on investment. Businesses that prioritize their financial bottom line aim to achieve financial success while also considering their impact on people and the planet.

TBL is often used as a framework for sustainability reporting and measuring a business's impact on society and the environment. By considering all three bottom lines, businesses can make informed decisions that take into account their impact on people, the planet, and their financial success.
