# Balance Sheet

A balance sheet is a financial statement that shows a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a particular point in time. It provides a snapshot of a company's financial position, helping stakeholders evaluate the company's financial health and potential for growth.

The balance sheet is based on the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. This means that a company's assets must equal the sum of its liabilities and equity.

Assets are resources that a company owns or controls that have economic value and can be used to generate future economic benefits. They are usually classified as current assets or long-term assets. Current assets are expected to be converted into cash within one year, while long-term assets are expected to provide benefits for more than one year.

Liabilities are obligations that a company owes to others and must be paid back at a future date. They are also usually classified as current liabilities or long-term liabilities. Current liabilities are expected to be paid within one year, while long-term liabilities are payable beyond one year.

Equity represents the residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting its liabilities. It includes the value of all shares of stock issued by the company and any retained earnings, which are profits that have not been distributed as dividends.

The balance sheet provides a summary of a company's financial health and can be used to evaluate its liquidity, solvency, and ability to generate cash flow. For example, a company with a large amount of current assets relative to its current liabilities may be considered financially stable and capable of paying its short-term obligations. However, if a company has a high level of debt relative to its equity, it may be considered less financially stable and have a higher risk of defaulting on its debts.
