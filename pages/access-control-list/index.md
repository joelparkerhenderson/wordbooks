# Access control list (ACL)

An access control list (ACL) is a security mechanism used in computer operating systems, network devices, and web applications to control access to resources. An ACL is a list of permissions that specifies which users or groups are allowed or denied access to a particular resource such as files, folders, directories, or network ports.

ACLs are based on the principle of discretionary access control (DAC), where the owner or creator of a resource determines who can access the resource and what actions they can perform on it. An ACL consists of one or more access control entries (ACEs) that contain information about the resource and the permissions granted to users or groups.

There are two types of ACLs: standard and extended. Standard ACLs are used to control access to a resource based on the source IP address, while extended ACLs allow more granular control of access to a resource based on the source IP address, destination IP address, protocol, and port number.

ACLs are commonly used in network security devices such as firewalls and routers to filter traffic based on source and destination addresses, protocols, and port numbers. They are also used in file systems to control access to files and directories based on user permissions.

One of the key advantages of using ACLs is their flexibility and granularity. ACLs allow administrators to grant or deny access to specific resources to specific users or groups. This level of control helps to ensure that only authorized users are able to access sensitive resources, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Additionally, ACLs can be easily modified to adjust permissions as needed, making it easy to adapt to changing security requirements or user needs.
