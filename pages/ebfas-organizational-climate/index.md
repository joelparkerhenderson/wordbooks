* Einheit (oneness): Means unity, or unit. This is a shared outlook possessed by a group of leaders, and represents a unifying theme that can be used to simultaneously encourage subordinate initiative yet realize superior intent.

* Behendigkeit (agility). Means nimbleness, quickness, swiftness. This is the ability to break out of longstanding patterns, even if they have been successful.

* Fingerspitzengefühl (fingertip feeling). Means intuitive flair or instinct. It describes a great situational awareness, and the ability to respond appropriately and tactfully, such as a superior ability to respond to an escalated situation.

* Auftragstaktik (task tactic). This is a form of military tactics where the emphasis is on the outcome of a mission rather than the specific means of achieving it. 
  
* Schwerpunkt (main point). Means the center of gravity, focus of main effort, focus and direction. This is a heuristic to make decisions from tactics to strategy about priority. Everyone from leaders to supports should know the schwerpunkt i.e. know what is most important and why.
