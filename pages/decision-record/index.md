# Decision record (DR)

A decision record (DR) is a document that captures the decision-making process, the rationale behind the decision, and any associated actions or next steps. It is used to communicate and document important decisions made within a team or organization.

The purpose of a decision record is to provide a clear record of the decision-making process, which can be used for future reference, accountability, and transparency. Decision records are often used in project management, software development, and other collaborative environments where decisions are made by multiple people.

A decision record typically includes the following information: a title, a date, a context summary, a description of the decision in depth, a list of stakeholders, and advice for implmentors. Decision record templates can help with creating this information.

Decision records can be created in various formats, including documents, spreadsheets, and online tools. They can be shared with relevant stakeholders to ensure that everyone is aware of the decision and its implications.

Some benefits of using decision records include:

* Transparency: Decision records provide transparency into the decision-making process, helping to build trust and accountability within a team or organization.

* Documentation: Decision records provide a clear and concise record of the decision, which can be used for future reference and as a historical record.

* Clarity: Decision records help to ensure that everyone involved in the decision-making process has a clear understanding of the decision, its rationale, and its implications.

* Consistency: Decision records help to ensure that similar decisions are made consistently over time, using the same criteria and decision-making process.
