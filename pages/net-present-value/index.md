# Net Present Value (NPV) 

Net Present Value (NPV) is a financial metric that helps businesses evaluate the profitability of an investment by comparing the present value of expected cash inflows to the present value of expected cash outflows over a given period of time. In other words, NPV measures the net difference between the present value of expected future cash flows and the initial investment amount.

To calculate the NPV, a discount rate is used to adjust the future cash flows to their present value. The discount rate takes into account the time value of money and the risk associated with the investment. The higher the risk of the investment, the higher the discount rate used to calculate the present value.

The formula for calculating NPV is as follows:

NPV = -Initial Investment + [CF1 / (1 + r)^1] + [CF2 / (1 + r)^2] + ... + [CFn / (1 + r)^n]

Where:

* CF represents the expected cash flow for a particular year

* r represents the discount rate

* n represents the number of years

A positive NPV indicates that the investment is profitable and should be pursued, while a negative NPV indicates that the investment is not profitable and should be avoided. NPV can also be used to compare multiple investment opportunities by selecting the one with the highest NPV.
