# Access control

Access control is a security mechanism that controls access to resources, information or services in a computer system or network. It involves granting or denying permissions to individuals, groups or computer systems based on predefined policies or rules.

Access control can be implemented at various levels, including physical access control, network access control, and application-level access control. In physical access control, physical barriers such as doors, locks, or keycards are used to control access to buildings, rooms, or data centers. Network access control involves controlling access to a network or computer system based on user authentication and authorization, such as usernames and passwords, digital certificates or biometric authentication. Application-level access control involves controlling access to software applications or services, based on user roles, privileges or permissions.

Access control systems typically use a combination of different techniques and technologies to achieve their goals, including identity management, authentication, authorization, and auditing. Identity management involves managing user identities and ensuring that only authorized users are given access to the system or resource. Authentication verifies the identity of a user through the use of passwords, smart cards, biometric sensors or other means. Authorization determines the actions that an authenticated user can perform on the system or resource, based on their role, privileges or permissions. Auditing involves tracking and monitoring access to resources, services or information to detect and prevent unauthorized access or security breaches.

Access control is an important aspect of information security, as it helps to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches and cyber attacks. It is widely used in various industries, including healthcare, finance, government, and retail, where sensitive data and information need to be protected from unauthorized access or disclosure.
