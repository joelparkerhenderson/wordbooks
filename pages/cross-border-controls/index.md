# Cross-border controls 

Cross-border controls are a set of policies, procedures, and measures put in place by governments and regulatory authorities to regulate the flow of goods, services, capital, and people across international borders. These controls are designed to promote national security, protect public health, and safeguard the economic interests of countries.

Immigration controls are put in place to manage the movement of people across borders. These controls can take the form of visa requirements, passport checks, and border security measures. The goal of immigration controls is to ensure that only individuals who meet the legal requirements to enter a country are allowed to do so.

Customs and trade regulations are used to control the flow of goods across borders. These regulations include tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers that are designed to protect domestic industries and prevent the import of illegal goods.

Financial controls manage the flow of capital across borders. These controls can include restrictions on foreign investment, currency exchange controls, and anti-money laundering measures. The goals are to prevent capital flight, protect domestic industries, and prevent illegal activities.

Cross-border controls help maintain the security and stability of a country. However, they create barriers to international trade and investment. Governments must strike a balance between protecting national interests and promoting cooperation. Governments can negotiate international trade agreements and investment treaties, which help promote the flow of goods, services, capital, and people across borders, while also protecting national interests.
