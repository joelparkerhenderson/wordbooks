# Advertising business model

The advertising business model is a type of business model where a company generates revenue by selling advertising space or time to other companies. In this model, the company's primary focus is on creating content or services that will attract a large audience or user base, which can then be monetized through advertising.

The advertising business model typically involves several key components:

* Audience or user base: The company creates content or services that attract a large audience or user base. This can take various forms, such as a website, mobile app, or social media platform.

* Advertising space or time: The company sells advertising space or time on its platform to other companies. This can take various forms, such as banner ads, sponsored content, or video ads.

* Targeting and measurement: The company provides tools that allow advertisers to target their ads to specific audiences or users, based on factors such as demographics, interests, and behavior. The company also provides measurement and analytics tools that allow advertisers to track the effectiveness of their ads.

* Revenue sharing: The company typically generates revenue by sharing a portion of the advertising revenue with the content creators or service providers on its platform.
