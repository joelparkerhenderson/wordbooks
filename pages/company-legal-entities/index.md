# Company legal entities

When starting a company, you can choose its type of legal entity. The three most common types in the United States are C-Corporations, Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), and partnerships.

C-Corporation: This entity is separate from its owners, or shareholders. The corporation can own assets, enter into contracts, and conduct business in its own name. C-Corporations are taxed as separate entities; this means they pay corporate income tax on their profits. Shareholders are taxed on dividends they receive. A benefit of a C-Corporation is that it offers limited liability protection to its shareholders; this means they are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation. C-Corporations can issue stock for raising capital.

Limited Liability Company (LLC): This entity combines the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership. Like a C-Corporation, an LLC is separate from its owners, but the LLC itself is not taxed. Instead, the profits and losses of the LLC are passed through to the owners and are taxed on their personal tax returns. LLCs offer limited liability protection to their owners; this means they are not personally responsible for the debts and obligations of the business. LLCs are relatively easy to form and maintain, and they offer flexibility in terms of ownership and management structure.

Partnership: This entity is formed when two or more people agree to carry on a business together. Partnerships can be either general partnerships or limited partnerships. In a general partnership, all partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. In a limited partnership, there are both general partners (who have unlimited liability) and limited partners (who have limited liability). Partnerships are not taxed as separate entities; instead, the profits and losses of the partnership are passed through to the partners and are taxed on their personal tax returns. Like LLCs, partnerships are relatively easy to form and maintain, and they offer flexibility in terms of ownership and management structure.
