# Company legal entities

When starting a business, one of the most important decisions you need to make is choosing the type of legal entity that your business will take. The three most common types of legal entities for businesses in the United States are C-Corporations, Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), and partnerships.

* C-Corporation: A C-Corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its owners, or shareholders. This means that the corporation can own assets, enter into contracts, and conduct business in its own name. C-Corporations are taxed as separate entities, which means that they pay corporate income tax on their profits. Shareholders of a C-Corporation are also taxed on any dividends they receive. One of the benefits of a C-Corporation is that it offers limited liability protection to its shareholders. This means that the shareholders are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation. Additionally, C-Corporations can issue stock, which can be a useful tool for raising capital.

* Limited Liability Company (LLC): An LLC is a legal entity that combines the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership. Like a C-Corporation, an LLC is separate from its owners, but the LLC itself is not taxed. Instead, the profits and losses of the LLC are passed through to the owners and are taxed on their personal tax returns. LLCs offer limited liability protection to their owners, which means that they are not personally responsible for the debts and obligations of the business. Additionally, LLCs are relatively easy to form and maintain, and they offer flexibility in terms of ownership and management structure.

* Partnership: A partnership is a legal entity that is formed when two or more people agree to carry on a business together. Partnerships can be either general partnerships or limited partnerships. In a general partnership, all partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. In a limited partnership, there are both general partners (who have unlimited liability) and limited partners (who have limited liability). Partnerships are not taxed as separate entities. Instead, the profits and losses of the partnership are passed through to the partners and are taxed on their personal tax returns. Like LLCs, partnerships are relatively easy to form and maintain, and they offer flexibility in terms of ownership and management structure.
