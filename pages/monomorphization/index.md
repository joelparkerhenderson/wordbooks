# Monomorphization

Monomorphization is a technique used in computer programming to optimize code performance by generating specialized versions of generic code. In programming languages that support generic programming, generic code is code that can work with multiple types of data, rather than being written for a single type. This generic code is usually slower than code that is specifically designed to work with a single type, since it has to perform additional runtime checks to ensure that it can work with any type of data that is passed to it.

Monomorphization is a way to speed up generic code by generating specialized versions of the generic code for each type of data that it is used with. This specialized code is faster than the generic code because it does not need to perform any runtime checks or type conversions, and can be optimized specifically for the type of data it is designed to work with.

For example, suppose we have a generic function that performs some operation on its input, and that works with any type of data that supports the + operator, including numbers, strings, and arrays. However, if we know that the function will only ever be used with numbers, we can generate a specialized version of the function that is optimized for number inputs.

This specialized version of the function is faster than the generic version, because it does not need to perform any runtime checks or type conversions.

Monomorphization is used in many programming languages, including C++, Rust, and JavaScript, and is a common optimization technique in compilers and runtime environments.
