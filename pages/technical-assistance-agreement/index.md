# Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA)

A Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA) is a legal agreement between a U.S. company and a foreign entity that outlines the terms of a technical assistance program. The program involves providing technical data, training, or other assistance to the foreign entity for the purpose of facilitating the development, production, operation, or maintenance of defense articles or defense services.

The TAA is regulated by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The DDTC oversees the export and temporary import of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data, which includes information that is directly related to defense articles and services.

The TAA must be signed by both the U.S. company and the foreign entity, and must include detailed information about the technical assistance being provided, as well as the terms and conditions of the agreement. The TAA may include restrictions on the use or transfer of the technical data, limitations on the duration of the technical assistance program, and provisions for safeguarding the technical data.

The TAA is an important tool for U.S. companies seeking to enter into business relationships with foreign entities for the purpose of providing technical assistance related to defense articles or services. By complying with the regulations and requirements of the TAA, U.S. companies can help to ensure that their technical data and other sensitive information is protected, while also facilitating the development and production of defense articles and services around the world.
