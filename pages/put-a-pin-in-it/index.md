# Put a pin in it

"Put a pin in it" is a common expression used in various settings, including business and project management. The phrase means to temporarily set aside a particular topic or issue to be discussed or addressed later, allowing the conversation or activity to move forward without getting bogged down by that specific item.

The concept behind this phrase is that sometimes during discussions or meetings, certain topics may be important but not immediately relevant to the current agenda or discussion. Rather than spending time discussing it, which can lead to distraction and derailment of the current topic, participants can agree to "put a pin in it" and come back to it later.

This phrase can also be used in project management, particularly when managing a large project with multiple stakeholders. In this context, "putting a pin in it" means recording a particular item or issue to be addressed later in the project plan, ensuring that nothing is overlooked or forgotten.
