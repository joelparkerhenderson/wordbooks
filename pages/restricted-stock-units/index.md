# Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) are a type of equity compensation offered by companies to their employees. RSUs represent a promise to give an employee a specific number of company shares at a future date. The shares are typically granted to the employee in the form of a vesting schedule, which is usually based on the employee's length of service or achievement of certain performance targets.

RSUs are similar to stock options in that they are a form of equity compensation. However, there are some important differences between the two. Stock options give employees the right to buy a certain number of shares of stock at a set price, whereas RSUs grant employees actual stock shares.

Another difference is that RSUs have a vesting schedule, while stock options may or may not have one. Vesting schedules for RSUs may vary depending on the company, but are typically between three and five years. Once RSUs vest, employees can choose to sell the shares or hold onto them.

One advantage of RSUs is that they are less risky than stock options. This is because the value of RSUs is tied to the current market price of the company's stock, while the value of stock options is tied to the future market price of the company's stock. In addition, RSUs are typically taxed at a lower rate than stock options.

RSUs are a popular form of equity compensation offered by many companies. They provide employees with a sense of ownership in the company and can be a valuable tool for retaining top talent. However, it's important for employees to understand the vesting schedule and tax implications of RSUs before accepting them as part of their compensation package.
