# Mission statement

A mission statement is a concise statement that describes the purpose and values of a business or organization. It serves as a guide for decision-making, provides direction for the company's strategy and operations, and communicates the company's values to stakeholders, such as employees, customers, investors, and partners.

A well-crafted mission statement typically includes the following elements:

1. Purpose: The statement should clearly articulate the company's reason for existence, what it hopes to accomplish, and why it matters.

2. Values: The statement should reflect the company's core values and principles, such as integrity, excellence, or innovation.

3. Target audience: The statement should identify the company's target audience, such as customers, investors, or employees, and what their needs or expectations are.

4. Distinctiveness: The statement should differentiate the company from its competitors and highlight its unique strengths and advantages.

Here is an example of a mission statement from Amazon: "Our vision is to be Earth's most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online." This mission statement clearly identifies Amazon's target audience, which is customers who want to buy products online. It also reflects the company's commitment to being customer-centric and its vision of being the best in the industry.

A well-crafted mission statement can help a business to align its strategy and operations with its core values and purpose. It can also serve as a tool for attracting and retaining customers, employees, and investors who share the company's values and vision.
