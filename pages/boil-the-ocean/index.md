# Boil the ocean

"Boil the ocean" is an idiomatic expression that is used to describe a task or project that is so complex, difficult, or extensive that it is virtually impossible to complete. The phrase suggests an impossible task, as boiling the ocean would be impossible due to its size.

In a business context, "boil the ocean" is often used to describe a project or task that is too ambitious or too broad in scope, making it difficult or impossible to achieve. It can also refer to a situation where an organization is trying to solve all of its problems at once, without a clear sense of priorities or a realistic understanding of the resources required to accomplish the task.

In project management, "boil the ocean" can be used to warn against taking on a project that is too large in scope, without first breaking it down into manageable, achievable pieces. The term can also be used to describe a project that is over-ambitious and lacks a clear focus or direction.

In essence, "boil the ocean" is a cautionary phrase that suggests the importance of focusing on achievable goals and breaking complex projects down into smaller, more manageable tasks. It is a reminder that success often comes from taking small, incremental steps, rather than attempting to achieve everything at once.
