# Blue Ocean Strategy

Blue Ocean Strategy is a business strategy framework that seeks to create uncontested market space and make competition irrelevant by creating new demand and targeting new customers. The concept was introduced by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne in their book "Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant".

The traditional business strategy is based on competition, where companies compete in the same industry for the same customers, resulting in a "red ocean" of bloody competition. In contrast, Blue Ocean Strategy focuses on creating a "blue ocean" of uncontested market space where competition is irrelevant.

The Blue Ocean Strategy framework involves four steps:

* Eliminate: Identify which factors of the industry should be eliminated that are no longer needed, such as certain product features, distribution channels, or customer segments.

* Reduce: Identify which factors should be reduced well below the industry standard, such as price, delivery time, or product complexity.

* Raise: Identify which factors should be raised well above the industry standard, such as quality, service, or customer experience.

* Create: Identify which factors should be created that the industry has never offered before, such as new features, services, or channels.

By following these steps, companies can create a new market space that is different from the existing market, enabling them to generate new demand, gain market share, and ultimately create sustainable growth. The Blue Ocean Strategy framework has been applied in a wide range of industries, from automotive to education to healthcare, with many success stories of companies that have implemented the framework and achieved significant growth.
