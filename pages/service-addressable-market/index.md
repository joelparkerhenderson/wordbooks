# Service Addressable Market (SAM)

A Service Addressable Market (SAM) is the portion of the total market for a particular product or service that a company can realistically target and serve with its offerings. 

To calculate the SAM, companies typically begin with a thorough analysis of the market, including the size and growth rate of the overall market, market trends, and customer needs and preferences. They then identify the specific segments of the market that are most relevant to their offerings based on factors such as geography, industry, customer demographics, and other relevant criteria. Finally, they estimate the size and revenue potential of each segment to determine the SAM.


For example, if a company sells a cloud-based project management tool, its total addressable market (TAM) might include all businesses and organizations that could potentially benefit from such a tool. However, the company's SAM might be limited to businesses within a certain industry or geographic region, or those of a certain size or maturity level that are most likely to adopt the product.

Determining the SAM is important for several reasons. First, it helps companies understand the size and scope of the market opportunity and the potential revenue that can be generated by targeting a specific segment of customers. Second, it helps companies focus their resources on the most promising market segments, rather than trying to serve all potential customers. Third, it helps companies develop targeted marketing and sales strategies that can effectively reach and engage the intended audience.

The SAM can change over time as market conditions and customer needs evolve. Therefore, it's important for companies to regularly revisit the SAM and adjust as needed.
