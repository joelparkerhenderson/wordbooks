# Copyright 

Copyright is a legal concept that protects the expression of creative works, such as literature, music, art, software, and other original works of authorship. It is a type of intellectual property right that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to control the use and distribution of the work, and to receive compensation for its use.

In most countries, including the United States, copyright protection is automatically granted to original works of authorship as soon as they are created and fixed in a tangible form, such as a written manuscript or a recorded song. Registration with a government agency, such as the U.S. Copyright Office, is not required for copyright protection, but it can provide additional benefits, such as the ability to sue for infringement.

Copyright owners have the exclusive right to reproduce and distribute their works, as well as the right to create derivative works, such as translations, adaptations, or new arrangements of existing works. They also have the right to publicly perform and display their works. Copyrights typically last for the life of the author plus a certain number of years after their death, depending on the country and the type of work.

Copyright infringement occurs when someone uses or reproduces a copyrighted work without permission from the owner, or in a way that exceeds the scope of the owner's permission. Infringement can lead to legal action, including lawsuits for damages and injunctive relief to stop the infringing activity. However, there are also certain exceptions to copyright protection, such as fair use in the United States, which allows limited use of copyrighted works for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.
