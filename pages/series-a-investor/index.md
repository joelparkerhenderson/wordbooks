# Series A investor

A Series A investor is a venture capital firm or individual investor who provides funding to a startup that has already completed its initial seed round and is seeking additional funding to scale up its operations. At this stage, the startup has typically developed a working prototype or minimum viable product and has demonstrated some level of traction, such as customer acquisition or revenue generation.

The amount of funding provided by Series A investors can vary widely, but it is typically in the range of $2 million to $15 million. In exchange for their investment, Series A investors typically receive a significant ownership stake in the startup, usually in the form of preferred stock or convertible debt.

Series A investors often provide not only capital, but also guidance and expertise to the startup. They may sit on the startup's board of directors and help the company with strategic planning, hiring key personnel, and accessing additional sources of capital.

For startups, securing Series A funding is a significant milestone, as it allows them to scale up their operations and accelerate growth. However, it is also a challenging and competitive process, as there are typically many startups vying for the attention of a limited number of Series A investors.
