# Stealth mode

In the context of startups, "stealth mode" refers to a period of time during which a startup keeps its activities, plans, and product development under wraps and out of the public eye. The goal of stealth mode is to keep the startup's plans and ideas secret from competitors and the general public until the company is ready to launch.

During stealth mode, startups typically operate in "stealth" or "secret" and avoid publicizing their company or products, sometimes going as far as to operate under a different name or a code name. This is done to avoid unwanted attention from competitors, investors, and the media.

There are several reasons why a startup might choose to operate in stealth mode:

* Intellectual property protection: By keeping their plans and innovations a secret, startups can protect their intellectual property and prevent competitors from copying their ideas.

* Avoiding copycats: Stealth mode can help startups avoid copycats who might try to replicate their ideas before they have a chance to establish themselves.

* Focusing on product development: By operating in stealth mode, startups can focus on product development and refining their ideas without the pressure of public scrutiny.

* Building hype: The mystery and secrecy surrounding a startup in stealth mode can generate buzz and excitement, creating a sense of anticipation for the eventual launch.

Stealth mode is not without its challenges, however. Operating in secret can make it difficult to attract investors, customers, and talent, as potential partners may be hesitant to engage with a company that is not transparent about its plans and activities.
