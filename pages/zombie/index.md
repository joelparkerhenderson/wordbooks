# Zombie

A zombie is a company or project that continues to operate without growing, thriving, or dying, often because it is unable to secure funding or generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations. The term "zombie" refers to the fact that the company is neither alive nor dead but is instead in a state of limbo.

Zombie companies often characterized by a lack of innovation and growth, as they are focused on simply maintaining their current operations rather than expanding into new markets or developing new products. This can result in a stagnation of the company's financial position, making it difficult to attract new investment or generate revenue from new customers.

While zombie companies or zombie projects may be able to continue operating for an extended period of time, they are typically not sustainable in the long run. Without growth or innovation, the company or project may eventually become irrelevant and fade away, or it may be forced to shut down due to financial pressures. Therefore, it is important for company teams and project teams to constantly evaluate their growth potential and take steps to address any issues that may be hindering their growth.
