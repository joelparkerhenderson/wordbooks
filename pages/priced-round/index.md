# Priced round

A priced round in venture capital refers to a type of investment round where the company and the investors agree on a valuation of the company before the investment is made. This is in contrast to an uncapped or convertible note, where the company and the investors do not agree on a valuation at the time of investment.

In a priced round, the company typically issues new shares of its stock to the investors in exchange for cash. The price per share is determined by the agreed-upon valuation of the company, which is usually based on a combination of factors such as revenue, user growth, market size, and the team's experience.

Priced rounds are typically used for later-stage startups that have a clear track record of success and are seeking larger amounts of funding. By agreeing on a specific valuation, the company is able to raise a specific amount of capital without diluting existing shareholders excessively. Priced rounds are also beneficial for investors, as they provide more certainty around their potential returns and allow them to negotiate better terms such as board seats or additional rights.

However, priced rounds can also be more complex and time-consuming than other types of investment rounds, as they require more extensive due diligence and negotiations around valuation. Additionally, if the company does not meet the agreed-upon targets or fails to deliver on promised growth, the valuation can become a source of tension between the company and its investors.
