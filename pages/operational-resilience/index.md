# Operational resilience

Operational resilience is the ability of an organization to continue operating even in the face of unexpected disruptions or failures.

Operational resilience involves the ability to recover from disruptions, and the ability to adapt and evolve in response to changing circumstances. This may include developing contingency plans, establishing redundant systems and processes, investing in technology and infrastructure, and cultivating a culture of resilience across the organization.

Operational resilience is especially important in industries where even brief disruptions can have serious consequences, such as financial services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure. 

Operational resilience includes the following steps:

* Risk assessment: Identifying potential sources of disruption, such as cyber threats, natural disasters, and human errors, and assessing the likelihood and potential impact of each.

* Business impact analysis: Assessing the potential consequences of disruptions on critical business processes, services, and operations, as well as on customers, employees, and other stakeholders.

* Strategy development: Developing strategies and plans to minimize the impact of disruptions and ensure the continuity of critical business processes, services, and operations.

* Implementation: Implementing the strategies and plans, including the development of contingency plans, the establishment of redundant systems and processes, and the investment in technology and infrastructure.

* Testing and validation: Testing and validating the strategies and plans through regular simulations, drills, and exercises to identify gaps and areas for improvement.

* Continuous improvement: Continuously monitoring and improving the resilience of the organization through ongoing risk assessments, business impact analyses, and strategy reviews.
