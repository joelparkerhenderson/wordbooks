# Non-solicitation agreement

A non-solicitation agreement is a legal contract between an employer and an employee that prohibits the employee from soliciting the employer's clients, customers, or other employees for a specified period of time after the employee leaves the company.

The purpose of a non-solicitation agreement is to protect a company's business relationships and prevent an employee from taking advantage of the relationships that they developed while working for the company. Non-solicitation agreements are often used in industries where employees have access to confidential information and where relationships with clients and customers are critical to the success of the business, such as sales or consulting.

A typical non-solicitation agreement may include the following provisions:

* Prohibition on solicitation: The employee agrees not to solicit the employer's clients, customers, or employees for a specified period of time after leaving the company. This may also include a prohibition on working for a competitor or starting a competing business.

* Definition of solicitation: The agreement may define what constitutes solicitation, such as direct contact, indirect contact, or advertising to the employer's clients, customers, or employees.

* Scope of the agreement: The agreement may specify the geographic area and duration of the non-solicitation clause.

* Exceptions: The agreement may provide exceptions to the non-solicitation clause, such as if the client or customer contacts the employee on their own initiative.

* Remedies: The agreement may specify the remedies that the employer can seek if the employee violates the non-solicitation agreement, such as injunctions or damages.

It is important to note that non-solicitation agreements must be reasonable in scope and duration to be enforceable. Courts may strike down overly broad or unreasonable non-solicitation agreements as a restraint of trade.
