# Non-solicitation agreement

A non-solicitation agreement is a legal contract between an employer and an employee that prohibits the employee from soliciting the employer's clients, customers, or other employees for a specified period of time after the employee leaves the company.

The purpose is to protect a business relationships, and prevent an employee from taking advantage of the relationships that they developed while working for the company. Non-solicitation agreements are often used in industries where employees have access to confidential information and where relationships with clients and customers are critical.

A typical non-solicitation agreement may include:

* Prohibition on solicitation: The employee agrees not to solicit the employer's clients, customers, or employees for a specified period of time after leaving the company. This may also include a prohibition on working for a competitor or starting a competing business.

* Definition of solicitation, such as direct contact, indirect contact, or advertising to the employer's clients, customers, or employees.

* Scope of the agreement, such as the geographic area, industry sector area, and duration of the non-solicitation clause.

* Exceptions, such as if the client or customer contacts the employee on their own initiative.

* Remedies that the employer can seek if the employee violates the non-solicitation agreement, such as injunctions or damages.

To be enforceable, non-solicitation agreements must be specific and reasonable. Courts may strike down broad or unreasonable non-solicitation agreements as a restraint of trade.
