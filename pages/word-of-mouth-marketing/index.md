# Word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM)

Word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM) is a type of marketing strategy that aims to increase brand awareness, customer engagement, and sales by leveraging positive recommendations and referrals from satisfied customers. It involves encouraging customers to share their positive experiences with others, either in person or through online channels such as social media, review sites, and blogs.

WOMM is based on the premise that people trust the opinions and recommendations of their friends and family more than they trust traditional advertising. By generating positive buzz about a product or service through word-of-mouth, businesses can create a sense of credibility and trust that is difficult to achieve through other marketing channels.

There are several strategies that businesses can use to encourage word-of-mouth marketing. One of the most effective is to provide exceptional customer service and a high-quality product or service that exceeds customers' expectations. By delighting customers, businesses can increase the likelihood that they will recommend their product or service to others.

Another strategy is to incentivize customers to share their positive experiences with others. This could involve offering discounts or other rewards for referrals, or running a contest or giveaway that encourages customers to share their experiences on social media.

Finally, businesses can leverage online review sites and social media platforms to amplify positive word-of-mouth. By monitoring and responding to customer reviews and comments on these channels, businesses can engage with their customers and build a community of brand advocates.
