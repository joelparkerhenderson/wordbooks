# Sales Led Growth (SLG)

Sales Led Growth (SLG) is a business strategy that prioritizes sales as the primary driver of growth. This approach is particularly relevant for B2B companies that sell complex products or services, which require a consultative sales approach and a longer sales cycle.

In an SLG model, the focus is on generating new sales and revenue by leveraging the company's existing customer base, developing a strong sales team, and building a sales process that is optimized for high conversion rates. This often involves investing heavily in sales and marketing efforts, such as lead generation, targeted advertising, and customer relationship management.

The SLG approach is typically contrasted with other growth models, such as Product Led Growth (PLG) or Marketing Led Growth (MLG), which prioritize product development or marketing efforts, respectively. However, it's important to note that these models are not mutually exclusive, and many successful companies incorporate elements of all three approaches.

SLG can be particularly effective in industries where sales expertise and relationships are key to closing deals, such as enterprise software or professional services. However, it also requires a significant investment in sales training, compensation, and support infrastructure, as well as a focus on customer success to ensure that existing customers continue to generate revenue over time.
