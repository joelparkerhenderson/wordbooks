# Microcredentials

Microcredentials, also known as digital badges, are short-form educational programs that provide individuals with the opportunity to gain a specific set of skills or knowledge in a particular subject area. Unlike traditional academic degrees or diplomas, microcredentials are usually focused on a specific skill or competency and can be completed in a shorter time frame.

Microcredentials can take many forms, including online courses, workshops, seminars, and other forms of training. They are often provided by universities, professional organizations, and industry associations, and are becoming increasingly popular as a way for individuals to upskill or reskill in response to changing workforce demands.

One of the main advantages of microcredentials is their flexibility. Because they are often self-paced and delivered online, they can be completed while working full-time or managing other commitments. They can also be stacked together to create a larger credential or qualification.

Microcredentials typically use digital badges to certify the completion of the program. These badges can be displayed on social media profiles, resumes, and other online platforms, allowing individuals to showcase their skills and knowledge to potential employers.
