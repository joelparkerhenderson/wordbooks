# UK Global Talent Visa

The United Kingdom Global Talent Visa is a category of visa designed to attract highly skilled individuals from around the world to contribute to the UK's innovation and research sectors. It is part of the UK's points-based immigration system and is aimed at individuals who demonstrate exceptional talent or promise in specific fields. 

Details:

* Eligibility Criteria: To be eligible for the UK Global Talent Visa, applicants must be internationally recognized as leaders or potential leaders in one of the following fields: a. Science, engineering, humanities, medicine, digital technology, or arts and culture (including film and television); b. Academic research in any field; c. An emerging field or technology with significant potential for economic growth.

* Endorsement Requirement: Applicants for the Global Talent Visa must first obtain an endorsement from a designated endorsing body recognized by the UK government. Each field has its own endorsing body, such as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) for science and research or Tech Nation for digital technology. The endorsing bodies assess applicants based on their achievements, impact, and potential to contribute to the UK in their respective fields.

* Application Process: Once an applicant receives an endorsement, they can apply for the Global Talent Visa. The application includes providing personal and professional information, evidence of accomplishments, a personal statement, and endorsement details. Applicants also need to demonstrate their knowledge of the English language.

* Immigration Rules: The Global Talent Visa has some unique immigration rules that set it apart from other visa categories. Notably, there is no requirement for a job offer or sponsorship from a UK employer. Successful applicants have the freedom to work in any sector and change employers without requiring further authorization.

* Points-Based System: The Global Talent Visa operates on a points-based system. Applicants must meet the mandatory criteria and accumulate sufficient points to be eligible. Points are awarded for endorsement from a recognized body, meeting the criteria for the relevant field, and demonstrating a proven track record of achievement, innovation, and impact.

* Global Talent Visa Endorsement Route: In addition to the main Global Talent Visa category, there is a separate endorsement route for individuals who have received prestigious awards or recognition in their fields. This route allows applicants to bypass the usual endorsement process and proceed directly to the visa application.

* Validity and Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR): The initial Global Talent Visa is granted for a period of up to five years. After residing in the UK for either three or five years (depending on the specific route), visa holders can apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), also known as permanent residency. ILR allows individuals to live and work in the UK without any time restrictions.

* Dependent Family Members: Global Talent Visa holders can bring their dependents, including spouses, civil partners, and children under 18, to the UK. Dependents have the right to work or study in the UK without restrictions.

* Accelerated Settlement: Exceptionally talented individuals who have received a Global Talent Visa can benefit from accelerated settlement. If they meet specific criteria, they can apply for ILR after only three years instead of the usual five, providing an expedited path to permanent residency.
