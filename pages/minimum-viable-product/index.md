# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a product development strategy that emphasizes creating a basic version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and gather feedback for future development. The concept of MVP was popularized by Eric Ries in his book, "The Lean Startup," and has since become a widely used approach in product development.

The idea behind an MVP is to create a product that is viable enough to be released to early adopters and customers, while still being in the early stages of development. This approach allows companies to test the market, gather feedback, and iterate on their product before investing significant resources into fully developing and launching a product that may not meet customer needs or preferences.

The MVP approach involves identifying the core features and functions that are essential for the product to solve the problem it is designed for, and building those features into a basic version of the product. This version can be released to early adopters or customers for testing and feedback, which can then be used to inform future development and refine the product.

The MVP approach is particularly useful for startups and companies that are developing new products in untested markets or with uncertain customer needs. It allows companies to test the market and gather feedback with minimal investment and risk, and can help them avoid costly mistakes by ensuring that they are building a product that meets customer needs and preferences.

While the MVP approach emphasizes creating a basic version of a product with minimal features, it is important to note that an MVP should still be a quality product that is useful and solves a real problem for customers. The goal is to create a product that is viable enough to be released to early customers, while still being in the early stages of development and able to be refined based on feedback.
