# Dynamic programming algorithms

Dynamic programming (DP) is a problem-solving technique used in computer science and mathematics. It is used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving them in an optimal way. The approach is based on the principle of optimal substructure, which means that the optimal solution to a problem can be built from the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

Dynamic programming algorithms are widely used in a variety of fields, including computer science, economics, physics, biology, and engineering. Some common examples of problems that can be solved using DP include the Knapsack problem, the Longest Common Subsequence problem, and the Fibonacci sequence.

The basic steps involved in developing a Dynamic Programming algorithm are:

* Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.

* Define the value of an optimal solution recursively in terms of smaller subproblems.

* Compute the value of an optimal solution in a bottom-up fashion, by solving the subproblems in order of increasing size.

* Construct an optimal solution to the problem from the computed information.

One of the key benefits of Dynamic Programming is that it can reduce the time complexity of an algorithm by avoiding the repeated computation of subproblems. This is achieved by storing the solutions to subproblems in a table or array, so that they can be reused in the computation of larger subproblems.

Some popular Dynamic Programming algorithms include:

* The Knapsack problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit, and the total value is as large as possible.

* The Longest Common Subsequence problem: Given two sequences, find the longest subsequence present in both of them.

* The Edit Distance problem: Given two strings, determine the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other (insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character).
