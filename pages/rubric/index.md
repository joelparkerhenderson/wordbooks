# Rubric

A rubric is a tool used to assess and evaluate the quality of work produced by an individual or group. It typically consists of a set of criteria and corresponding levels of performance or achievement, often presented in a matrix or table format.

Rubrics are widely used in education to provide students with clear and specific guidelines for what is expected of them, as well as to provide teachers with a consistent and objective means of evaluating student work. They can also be used in various other settings, such as in the workplace or in evaluating research proposals.

There are various types of rubrics, including holistic rubrics, which provide an overall assessment of work, and analytic rubrics, which break down the assessment into specific components or criteria. Rubrics can also be designed to assess different levels of performance, from novice to expert, or to assess specific skills or competencies.

In general, rubrics are considered to be a more objective and fair method of evaluation than subjective methods such as grading on a curve or relying solely on an evaluator's personal judgment. They can also be used to provide students with feedback and opportunities for improvement, as well as to facilitate communication and collaboration between teachers, students, and other stakeholders.
