# Startup entrances

Startup entrances refer to the various ways entrepreneurs and early-stage companies enter the startup ecosystem.

Startup entrances can benefit fromâ€¦

Incubators: These are programs that support early stage startups. They can provide workspace, mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to resources such as legal, accounting, and marketing support. Incubators typically accept startups at ideation, and help them refine their business models, validate their ideas, and prepare for market entry.

Accelerators: These are programs that speed up startup growth. They typically offer a structured curriculum, mentorship, funding, and access to a network of investors, industry experts, and potential customers. Accelerators focus on rapidly scaling startups and helping them achieve milestones within a defined timeframe, often 3-6 months.

Skunkworks: These are in-house, highly autonomous, and often secretive innovation teams within a larger organization. Skunkworks teams explore disruptive ideas and work on projects independent of the organization's regular processes and bureaucracy. This fosters innovation and encourages entrepreneurial thinking.

Spinoffs and spinouts: These refer to the creation of a new independent company from within an existing organization. A spinoff is when a parent company deliberately separates a division, project, unit, or the like. A spinout is when parent company employees choose to leave to start their own company. The new company has its own management, capital, and strategy.

Technology Tranfers: These involve the creation of a new company based on intellectual property (IP) developed within a research institution, then licensed externally. Technology Tranfers typically occur when an innovation has commercial potential, and the best way is via a new startup using the IP and the researchers' expertise.
