# Startup entrances

Startup entrances refer to the various ways entrepreneurs and early-stage companies enter the startup ecosystem.

Startup entrances can benefit fromâ€¦

Incubators: These are programs or organizations that support the early stages of startup development. They can provide workspace, mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to resources such as legal, accounting, and marketing support. Incubators typically accept startups at ideation, and help them refine their business models, validate their ideas, and prepare for market entry.

Accelerators: These are programs designed to accelerate the growth and development of startups. They typically offer a structured curriculum, mentorship, funding, and access to a network of investors, industry experts, and potential customers. Accelerators are focused on rapidly scaling startups and helping them achieve significant milestones within a defined timeframe, often 3-6 months.

Skunkworks: These are in-house, highly autonomous, and often secretive innovation units within a larger organization. Skunkworks teams are given freedom to explore disruptive ideas and work on projects that are independent of the organization's regular processes and bureaucracy. Skunkworks allows companies to foster innovation, encourage entrepreneurial thinking, and potentially develop new products, services, or business models.

Spinoffs and spinouts: These refer to the creation of a new independent company from within an existing organization. A spinoff is when company deliberately separates a division, project, business, unit, or the like. A spinout is when company employees choose to leave to start their own company. Spinoffs and spinouts have their own management, capital, and strategy.

Technology Tranfers: These are similar to spinoffs and spinouts, but involve the creation of a new company based on intellectual property developed within a research institution. Technology Tranfers typically occur when an innovation has commercial potential, and the best way is to do it via a new startup in combination with the researchers, their IP, and their expertise.
