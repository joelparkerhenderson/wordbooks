# Churn rate

Churn rate is a metric used in business to measure the number of customers who cancel or don't renew their subscription to a service or product over a given period of time. It is also sometimes referred to as customer attrition rate or customer turnover rate. The churn rate is expressed as a percentage, with a higher percentage indicating a higher rate of customer loss.

The churn rate is an important metric for businesses, as it is a key indicator of customer satisfaction and loyalty. If the churn rate is high, it can indicate that customers are unhappy with the product or service, or that the company is failing to meet their needs. This can lead to a loss of revenue, as well as a negative impact on the company's reputation.

To calculate the churn rate, the number of customers lost over a given period of time is divided by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period. For example, if a company had 1,000 customers at the beginning of the month and lost 50 customers during that month, the churn rate would be 5% (50/1,000).

It's important to note that churn rate can be calculated in different ways, depending on the business model and industry. For example, for a subscription-based business, churn rate might be calculated on a monthly or annual basis. For an e-commerce business, it might be calculated based on the number of customers who don't make a repeat purchase within a certain timeframe.

Reducing churn rate is a priority for many businesses, as it can have a significant impact on revenue and growth. Companies can reduce churn rate by improving their product or service, providing better customer support, offering incentives or discounts to retain customers, and improving communication with customers to better understand their needs and concerns.
