# Tiered pricing

Tiered pricing is a pricing strategy in which a company charges different prices for different levels or tiers of a product or service based on the perceived value or usage of each tier. This strategy is often used to provide a range of options to customers with different needs, preferences, and budgets.

Typically, the tiers are structured in a way that offers increasing benefits or features as the customer moves up to a higher tier. For example, a software company might offer a basic plan with limited features at a lower price point, a standard plan with more features and functionality at a slightly higher price, and a premium plan with the most features and benefits at the highest price point.

Tiered pricing can be an effective way to increase revenue, as customers who are willing to pay more for additional features or benefits can be charged accordingly. Additionally, this strategy can help companies attract and retain customers with varying needs and budgets, as it allows them to choose a tier that best fits their needs.

However, it is important for companies to be careful in their implementation of tiered pricing, as it can also lead to customer confusion or frustration if the tiers are not well-defined or if the benefits of each tier are not clearly communicated. Additionally, companies must ensure that each tier offers value to the customer and is not seen as arbitrary or unfair.
