# Lock-up

In the context of stock options, a lock-up is a period of time during which the holder of the option cannot exercise it. Typically, the lock-up period begins when the stock options are granted and ends at a specified date in the future.

The purpose of a lock-up is to prevent the holder of the options from immediately exercising them and selling the underlying shares. This is often used in the context of an initial public offering (IPO) or a merger or acquisition (M&A), where the company's insiders may hold a large number of options that they could potentially exercise and sell, flooding the market with shares and depressing the price.

In an IPO, for example, company insiders may be subject to a lock-up period of six months or more following the offering. During this time, they cannot sell their shares or exercise their options, which helps to stabilize the stock price and prevent a sudden influx of shares onto the market.

Lock-ups are often negotiated as part of a company's equity compensation plan and can vary in length depending on the circumstances. They are designed to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders by preventing insider trading that could destabilize the stock price.
