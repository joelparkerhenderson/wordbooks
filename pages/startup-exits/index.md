# Startup exits

Startup exits refer to the strategies and processes through which startup founders and investors realize a return on their investment by exiting or selling their ownership stakes in a startup company. 

Typical exits includeâ€¦

Initial Public Offering (IPO): An IPO occurs when a startup offers its shares to the public for the first time on a stock exchange. The IPO's rigorous regulatory process enables the company to raise substantial capital for growth and expansion.

Acquisition/Acquihire/Merger: A larger company can purchas a startup, to gain access to its talent, customers, or intellectual property. This can provide a significant financial return, and enable the startup team to continue working.

Strategic Partnership/Joint Venture: Startups may opt for strategic partnerships or joint ventures with established companies. This allows both parties to collaborate, share resources, and leverage each other's strengths. 

Secondary Market Sales: Early-stage investors or employees can sell their ownership stakes in the startup to other investors. This can happen through private sales or specialized platforms designed for secondary market transactions.

Management Buyout: The existing management team of a startup may choose to buy out the ownership stakes of early investors. This occurs when founders or key executives have the resources and desire to take full control of the company.

Liquidation/Wind-Down: If a startup is unable to succeed, a decision may be made to wind down the business, liquidate its assets, pay off creditors, and distribute remaining funds to investors.
