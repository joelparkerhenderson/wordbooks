# Accelerator

An accelerator is a program designed to help early-stage startups rapidly grow their businesses and achieve success. Typically, an accelerator provides a cohort of selected startups with access to funding, mentorship, education, networking opportunities, and other resources over a fixed period of time, usually three to six months.

The goal of an accelerator is to help startups develop their products, validate their business models, build their teams, and acquire customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. Accelerators often provide seed funding to the startups in their cohorts in exchange for equity, as well as access to their networks of investors and other key players in the startup ecosystem.

Accelerators differ from incubators in that they are typically more structured, intensive, and time-limited programs. Incubators, on the other hand, are more long-term and flexible, providing startups with office space, infrastructure, and support services over an extended period of time, without the intensive training and mentoring that accelerators offer.

Accelerators have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in the technology sector, as a way to help startups get off the ground and gain traction quickly. Many of the most successful startups in recent years, including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe, have gone through accelerator programs to help them achieve their early growth and success.
