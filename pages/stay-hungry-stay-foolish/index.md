# Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish

"Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish" is a famous quotation printed as a farewell message of a publication named Whole Earth Catalog in its final issue in 1974.

The quotation became more famous because of Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc. Jobs mentioned in his commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005. The phrase has become a mantra for entrepreneurs and creatives, encouraging them to never lose their curiosity and drive for learning, and to never be afraid to take risks and make mistakes.

Jobs used the phrase to convey his philosophy on life and work. He urged graduates to remain hungry for knowledge, new experiences, and challenges, and to always stay foolish enough to follow their dreams and take unconventional paths.

For Jobs, being "hungry" meant constantly seeking new ideas and knowledge, pushing oneself beyond perceived limits, and never becoming complacent. He believed that a curious and restless mindset was essential to success in any field.

The "foolish" aspect of the quote referred to taking risks and thinking outside the box. Jobs encouraged graduates to not be afraid to fail, to experiment, and to follow their intuition, even if it meant going against conventional wisdom or taking a non-traditional path.

"When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

"Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.”
