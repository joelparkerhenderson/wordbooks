# Direct sales business model

The direct sales business model is when a company sells its products or services directly to customers, without involving a middleman or retailer. Typically a company sales team is responsible for building relationships with customers and generating revenue.

The model is often used by companies that have complex or high-value products or services that require a more personalized sales approach. For example, companies that sell high-end technology products or financial services often use this model because their products require a more in-depth understanding and explanation.

There are several key components of the direct sales business model:

* Sales team: The sales team is the primary driver of revenue in this model. They are responsible for building relationships with customers, identifying their needs, and offering solutions.

* Sales process: The sales process in a direct sales model is typically more complex than in other models. The sales team must go through steps to qualify leads, present offerings, and close deals.

* Compensation structure: The compensation structure for sales teams in a direct sales model is often commission-based, incentivizing close more deals, increasing revenue per deal, and achieving higher earnings.

* Customer relationship management: The direct sales model relies heavily on building strong relationships with customers. Companies need to invest in effective customer relationship management (CRM) systems to manage customer interactions.

* Training and development: Because the sales process is more complex in a direct sales model, companies need to invest in training and development programs to ensure their sales team has the necessary skills and knowledge to be successful.
