# Pre-money valuation and post-money valuation

Pre-money valuation and post-money valuation are both terms used in finance and investing to describe the value of a company before and after receiving an investment, respectively.

Pre-money valuation refers to the estimated value of a company prior to the injection of additional capital. In other words, it is the value of the company before any investment has been made. This is usually determined by analyzing the company's financials, assets, liabilities, intellectual property, customer base, and other relevant factors that can impact its value. For example, if a company is valued at $10 million before an investment is made, it has a pre-money valuation of $10 million.

Post-money valuation refers to the estimated value of a company after receiving additional capital through investment. In other words, it is the value of the company after the investment has been made. This valuation includes the pre-money valuation plus the amount of investment made. For example, if a company has a pre-money valuation of $10 million and receives a $5 million investment, then the post-money valuation is $15 million.

The difference between pre-money and post-money valuation is significant for investors because it determines the percentage of ownership they will have in the company. In the example above, the investor will own a portion of the company that is calculated as their investment divided by the post-money valuation, which is $5 million divided by $15 million i.e. 1/3 which is approximately 33%.
