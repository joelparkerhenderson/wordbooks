# Swoop and poop

"Swoop and poop" is a slang term used in business and project management to describe a situation where an individual or team comes into a project at the last minute and makes critical comments or decisions that undermine the work that has already been done. Essentially, the "swoop" refers to the sudden and unexpected entrance, while the "poop" refers to the negative impact of the comments or decisions.

The term can also be used to describe a situation where a manager or executive swoops in and takes credit for the work of others, without contributing significantly to the project themselves.

The term is often used in a negative context, as it implies a lack of communication and collaboration between team members, and a disregard for the work that has already been done. In order to avoid "swoop and poop" scenarios, it is important for team members to communicate regularly and openly, and for all stakeholders to be involved in the project from the outset.
