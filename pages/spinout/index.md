# Spinout

A spinout (a.k.a. employee spinout) refers to a new independent company that is created when a group of company employees decide to take a particular technology or product and develop it into a new company.

When employees decide to form a spinout, they often do so because they believe that they can develop the technology or product more effectively as a standalone company. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as a desire for greater control over the direction of the product or technology, a belief that the technology has greater potential than is currently being realized, or a desire to pursue the technology in a different market.

To create a spinout, the employees will typically need to secure funding to start the new company. This can come from a variety of sources, such as venture capital firms, angel investors, or strategic partners. Once funding is secured, the new company is formed and begins operations as an independent entity.

If the original company is supportive, then it may invest in the spinout. This can provide the original company and the spinout with mutual benefits, such as access to each other's customers, resources, and technologies.

If the original company is hostile, then it may attempt to compete, retaliate, or litigate for violations of non-compete, non-solicitation, and non-disclosure agreements.
