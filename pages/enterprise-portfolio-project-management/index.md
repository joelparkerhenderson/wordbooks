# Enterprise Portfolio Project Management (EPPM)

Enterprise Portfolio Project Management (EPPM) is a methodology that helps organizations manage their project portfolios in a more efficient and strategic manner. EPPM focuses on aligning projects with the organization's goals and objectives, and ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately to achieve those goals.

EPPM involves a structured approach to portfolio management, which typically includes the following steps:

* Project identification and prioritization: EPPM begins with identifying all potential projects and evaluating them based on strategic fit, potential ROI, and other relevant factors. This helps to prioritize the projects that should be pursued.

* Resource allocation: EPPM involves allocating resources to the prioritized projects in a manner that ensures maximum ROI and strategic alignment. This may involve reallocating resources from low-priority projects to high-priority ones.

* Risk management: EPPM involves identifying and managing risks associated with individual projects, as well as risks that may affect the overall portfolio.

* Performance tracking and reporting: EPPM involves tracking and reporting on the performance of individual projects and the overall portfolio. This allows stakeholders to monitor progress and make informed decisions about resource allocation and project prioritization.

* Continuous improvement: EPPM involves a continuous improvement process, where feedback from stakeholders is used to refine the portfolio management approach and improve project outcomes over time.

EPPM is particularly useful for large organizations with complex project portfolios, where it can be difficult to ensure that resources are being allocated effectively and in alignment with organizational goals. By taking a more strategic approach to portfolio management, EPPM helps organizations make better use of their resources and achieve their strategic objectives more efficiently.
