# Arbitration agreement

An arbitration agreement is a legal agreement between two or more parties that outlines how any disputes or disagreements between them will be resolved through arbitration rather than litigation.

Arbitration is a dispute resolution process that involves the use of an arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators to make a binding decision about the dispute. The decision is based on the evidence and arguments presented by the parties involved.

An arbitration agreement can be a standalone agreement or a clause included within a larger contract. It specifies the conditions under which disputes are to be resolved by arbitration rather than through the courts. The agreement typically outlines the following:

* The parties involved: The agreement specifies the parties involved in the dispute, including their legal names and contact information.

* The disputes covered: The agreement outlines the types of disputes that are covered by the arbitration process.

* The selection of arbitrators: The agreement specifies how the arbitrator or arbitrators will be selected.

* The rules of the arbitration: The agreement specifies the rules that will govern the arbitration process, including the procedural rules and the rules of evidence.

* The location and language of the arbitration: The agreement specifies the location and language of the arbitration.

* The decision-making process: The agreement outlines how the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators will make the final decision.

Arbitration agreements are commonly used in commercial contracts and employment contracts. They are generally preferred by businesses over litigation as they are typically faster, less expensive, and more private than traditional court proceedings.
