# Valuation approaches for startups

Startup valuation is the process of estimating the current or potential value of a startup. This process provides a basis for investment decision making, such as how much equity to give up in exchange for funding.

Typical approaches:

* Market approach: Look at the market value of similar startups or companies. Rely on comparable sales, industry benchmarks, and other market data to estimate the value of the startup. This approach is often used for startups that have already generated revenue, but it can be difficult to find truly comparable companies.

* Income approach: Look at the startup's future earnings and cash flow. Use discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which involves estimating the expected cash flows of the startup and discounting them to their present value. Use a capitalization of earnings model, which involves dividing the expected earnings by the capitalization rate. The income approach is often considered the most-reliable method of startup valuation, but it can be difficult to estimate future earnings accurately.

* Scorecard method: This approach is a hybrid of the market and income approaches. It looks at factors such as the startup's stage of development, market size, competition, and team experience, then assigns a score to each factor. The scores are used to estimate the startup's overall value. The scorecard method is often used for early-stage startups that don't have a lot of revenue or market data.

* Berkus method: This approach is by angel investor Dave Berkus. Evaluate the startup based on five factors: soundness of the idea, quality of the management team, size of the market, level of competition, and stage of development. Assign each factor a dollar value. The sum of the values is the startup's value. The Berkus method is often used for early-stage startups that don't have a lot of revenue or market data.
