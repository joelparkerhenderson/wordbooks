# Startup step-ups

A startup step-up is when a small business is operating at a steady level, then initiates a step up to become a startup.

Some examplesâ€¦

A solopreneur is an entrepreneur who starts and operates a business on their own. They handle all aspects of the business themselves, from planning and decision-making to execution and implementation. Solopreneurs typically offer specialized skills or services, such as freelance writing, graphic design, coaching, or consulting. Solopreneurship offers individuals the flexibility and independence to pursue their passions, control their work-life balance, and directly reap the rewards of their efforts. A solopreneur can step up to become a startup, such as via service automation.

A cottage business refers to a small-scale, home-based business that typically involves traditional crafts, handmade products, or localized services. These businesses often operate within the owner's residence and rely on local or niche markets for customers. Cottage businesses are known for their personalized and unique offerings, such as artisanal goods, homemade food products, or specialized services like tutoring or pet grooming. A cottage business can step up to become a startup, such as via mass production and mass marketing.

A lifestyle business is a business that has the primary goal of enhancing the owner's preferred way of life, rather than maximizing profits or growth. Examples of lifestyle businesses include boutique hotels, organic farms, travel blogs, or fitness studios. These businesses may deliberately avoid rapid expansion or external investments to maintain the desired lifestyle and minimize stress. A lifestyle business can step up to become a startup if the owner sells to a startup entreprenuer.
