# Lifetime value (LTV)

The lifetime value (LTV) of a customer is a concept in business that refers to the total amount of revenue that a customer is expected to generate for a company during their lifetime as a customer. It is an important metric for companies to consider when making decisions about customer acquisition and retention strategies.

To calculate the LTV of a customer, a company must take into account several factors, including the average purchase value, the number of purchases made by the customer over time, and the length of the customer's relationship with the company. This formula can be expressed as:

LTV = (Average Purchase Value x Number of Purchases per Year x Average Customer Lifespan)

For example, if the average purchase value for a customer is $100, and they make two purchases per year, and the average customer lifespan is five years, the LTV would be calculated as:

LTV = ($100 x 2 x 5) = $1,000

This means that, on average, this customer is expected to generate $1,000 in revenue for the company over the course of their relationship.

LTV is an important metric for companies because it helps them to understand the long-term value of acquiring and retaining customers. By knowing the LTV of a customer, a company can make more informed decisions about how much to spend on customer acquisition, as well as how much to invest in retention strategies such as loyalty programs or customer service initiatives.

Additionally, LTV can help a company to identify which types of customers are most valuable to their business. For example, if a company finds that customers who make larger purchases or who stay with the company for longer periods of time have a higher LTV, they may choose to focus their acquisition and retention efforts on these types of customers.
