# “Radical Candor” by Kim Scott

“Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity” is a book written by Kim Scott, a former executive at Google and Apple. The book provides practical advice for leaders and managers on how to build stronger relationships with their employees, communicate more effectively, and develop a culture of feedback and growth.

The core idea behind radical candor is that leaders should care personally and challenge directly. This means that leaders should establish a deep personal connection with their employees, while also providing them with honest and direct feedback. This approach is intended to create a supportive environment in which employees feel valued and encouraged to take risks and grow.

The book outlines several key principles for radical candor, including:

* Care personally: Leaders should show genuine concern for their employees as individuals, and take the time to build strong relationships with them.

* Challenge directly: Leaders should provide honest and direct feedback, even if it is uncomfortable or difficult.

* Create a culture of feedback: Leaders should encourage open communication and create opportunities for employees to give and receive feedback.

* Embrace discomfort: Leaders should be willing to have difficult conversations and deal with conflict in order to build stronger relationships and achieve better outcomes.

The book includes a range of real-world examples and practical advice for putting these principles into practice. It also addresses common challenges that leaders may face, such as how to give feedback effectively and how to handle difficult employees.
