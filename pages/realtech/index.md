* Blockchain Technology. This can create more secure and transparent transactions, reduce fraud, increase transparency, and improve the speed and efficiency of transactions.

* Big Data and Analytics. This can provide realtors with insights into market trends, customer behavior, and property values. This information can help companies to make more informed decisions about buying, selling, or leasing properties.

* IoT (Internet of Things). IoT devices can be used to monitor and control aspects of the property, such as energy usage, temperature, lighting, and security.
