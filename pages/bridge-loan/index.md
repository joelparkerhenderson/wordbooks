# Bridge loan

A bridge loan is a type of short-term financing that can help an individual or company bridge the gap between two financial transactions. Essentially, a bridge loan is designed to provide temporary financing while the borrower waits for more permanent financing to become available.

Bridge loans are often used in real estate transactions, where a borrower may need to close on a new property before their existing property sells. In this scenario, the bridge loan provides funds to close on the new property, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid when the borrower's existing property sells.

Bridge loans are typically short-term loans, with terms ranging from a few weeks to a few months. Interest rates on bridge loans are typically higher than traditional loans, reflecting the higher risk that the lender is taking on. Additionally, bridge loans may require collateral, such as real estate or other assets, to secure the loan.

While bridge loans can be a useful tool for borrowers, they can also be risky, as borrowers may be relying on uncertain future events, such as the sale of a property, to repay the loan. As such, it's important for borrowers to carefully consider the risks and costs of a bridge loan before pursuing this financing option.
