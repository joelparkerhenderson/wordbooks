# Trademark

A trademark is a symbol, word, phrase, or design that identifies and distinguishes a company's goods or services from those of others in the marketplace. It is a form of intellectual property that grants the owner exclusive rights to use the mark in commerce and to prevent others from using a similar mark that might cause confusion among consumers.

A trademark can be a word or combination of words, such as a company name or slogan, or it can be a logo or symbol. It can also be a sound, a color, or a combination of these elements. A trademark is usually registered with the government to obtain protection under trademark laws.

Trademarks serve as a source identifier and provide consumers with an assurance of quality and consistency in the products or services they purchase. They also protect the goodwill and reputation of a company, as well as the investment made in building and promoting a brand.

Trademarks can be registered at the national or international level, and the registration process involves filing an application with the relevant trademark office, along with a fee. Once registered, the owner of a trademark can use the symbol Â® to indicate that the mark is registered and protected.

Trademark infringement occurs when someone uses a mark that is similar to another mark in a way that is likely to cause confusion among consumers. In such cases, the owner of the trademark can take legal action to protect their rights and prevent further infringement.
