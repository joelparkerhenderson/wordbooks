# Investment Readiness Level (IRL)

Investment Readiness Level (IRL) is a tool used in the startup and venture capital community to evaluate the maturity of a startup's business plan and the potential of its technology or product. 

IRL is a scale ranging from 1 to 9, where 1 represents the very early stage of the startup, and 9 indicates a successful, revenue-generating business that has achieved its full potential.

The following is a brief description of each IRL level:
