# Accredited investor

An accredited investor is an individual or entity that meets specific requirements related to income, net worth, asset size, governance status, or professional experience, as defined by the securities laws of a particular jurisdiction. Accredited investors are typically permitted to participate in certain types of investment opportunities that are not available to the general public.

In the United States, an individual is considered an accredited investor if they meet one of the following criteria:

* They have earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the past two years, and reasonably expect the same for the current year; or

* They have a net worth over $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the value of their primary residence).

Entities, such as corporations, partnerships, and trusts, can also be accredited investors if they meet certain requirements, including having assets in excess of $5 million or being an entity composed entirely of accredited investors.

Accredited investor status provides individuals and entities with greater access to certain types of investment opportunities, such as private equity investments, hedge funds, and venture capital. These investments often involve higher risk, but also have the potential for higher returns. The rationale for limiting these investment opportunities to accredited investors is based on the assumption that these individuals and entities have a greater understanding of the risks involved and the ability to absorb potential losses.
