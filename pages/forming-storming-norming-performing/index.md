# Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing (FSNP)

Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing (FSNP) is a model that describes the stages of group development, which was introduced by Bruce Tuckman in 1965. It is a widely used model in the field of organizational psychology to understand how teams evolve and develop over time.

The four stages of group development:

1. Forming: Group members get to know each other, establish the purpose and goals of the group, and determine the task at hand. At this stage, there is usually a sense of excitement and anticipation, as well as anxiety and uncertainty about the group's future.

2. Storming: Group members begin to voice their opinions and ideas, which can often lead to conflicts and disagreements. Group members may challenge the leader, question the group's goals, and compete for power and influence. The storming stage is often marked by tension and frustration, but it is also an essential part of the group's development process.

3. Norming: Group members begin to develop a sense of cohesion and teamwork. Group members start to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, develop norms and rules for interaction, and establish a sense of group identity. At this stage, the group is beginning to work effectively towards its goals.

4. Performing: The group is fully functional, and members work together effectively to achieve the group's goals. The group has established a clear identity and norms, and there is a high level of trust, cooperation, and communication among group members. The group is now focused on achieving its objectives and delivering results.

The FSNP model is widely used, but it is not always linear: groups can go back and forth between stages, skip stages, or remain in a stage for an extended period. Additionally, different groups may experience each stage differently based on their goals, members, and context.
