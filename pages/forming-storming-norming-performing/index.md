# Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing (FSNP)

Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing (FSNP) is a model that describes the stages of group development, which was introduced by Bruce Tuckman in 1965. It is a widely used model in the field of organizational psychology to understand how teams evolve and develop over time.

The FSNP model describes the following four stages of group development:

* Forming: This is the initial stage where group members get to know each other, establish the purpose and goals of the group, and determine the task at hand. At this stage, there is usually a sense of excitement and anticipation, as well as anxiety and uncertainty about the group's future.

* Storming: In this stage, group members begin to voice their opinions and ideas, which can often lead to conflicts and disagreements. Group members may challenge the leader, question the group's goals, and compete for power and influence. The storming stage is often marked by tension and frustration, but it is also an essential part of the group's development process.

* Norming: This is the stage where the group begins to resolve its conflicts and develop a sense of cohesion and teamwork. Group members start to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, develop norms and rules for interaction, and establish a sense of group identity. At this stage, the group is beginning to work effectively towards its goals.

* Performing: In this final stage, the group is fully functional, and members work together effectively to achieve the group's goals. The group has established a clear identity and norms, and there is a high level of trust, cooperation, and communication among group members. The group is now focused on achieving its objectives and delivering results.

It is important to note that while the FSNP model is widely used, it is not always a linear process. Groups can go back and forth between stages, skip stages, or remain in a stage for an extended period. Additionally, different groups may experience each stage differently based on their goals, members, and context. However, understanding the FSNP model can help group leaders and members anticipate and navigate the challenges that arise during group development.
