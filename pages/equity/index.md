# Equity

Equity is a term used to describe the ownership interest in a company. For startups, equity often refers to the shares of the company that are held by its founders, investors, and employees. Equity is an important aspect of startup financing, as it represents a claim on the company's assets and future earnings.

Equity can be divided into different classes, each with its own set of rights and privileges. Common stock is the most basic form of equity and gives its holders the right to vote at shareholder meetings and receive a portion of the company's profits in the form of dividends. Preferred stock is another form of equity that has a higher claim on a company's assets and profits than common stock, but typically does not carry voting rights.

For startups, equity is often used as a means of attracting and retaining key employees and raising capital. Founders typically hold a significant portion of the company's equity, with the rest being allocated to investors in exchange for funding. Equity can also be used to incentivize employees through equity-based compensation plans, such as stock options or restricted stock units.

When issuing equity to investors, startups may offer different classes of stock with different rights and preferences. For example, a startup may issue preferred stock to investors with a liquidation preference, meaning that these investors will be paid out before common stockholders in the event of a sale or liquidation of the company. Other rights and preferences may include anti-dilution protection, which protects investors from dilution of their ownership stake in the company.
