# Commit

In Git, a commit is a snapshot of changes to a project that has been saved to the repository. It is a fundamental concept in Git and is used to record and track changes to the codebase over time. Each commit represents a specific version of the codebase and includes a message that describes the changes made in that version.

When you make changes to a file or multiple files in your codebase, you can stage those changes to be committed. Staging files means that you have selected which changes you want to include in your next commit. Once you have staged your changes, you can then create a commit.

A commit includes a unique identifier (known as a hash) that is automatically generated by Git. The hash ensures that each commit is unique and can be identified and tracked over time. Additionally, each commit includes a message that describes the changes made in that commit. This message should be concise and descriptive, and should explain the reason for the changes made in the commit.

One of the key benefits of using Git is that commits create a complete record of changes made to the codebase over time. This allows developers to easily track the evolution of the codebase, identify which changes were made and when, and revert to previous versions if necessary. Commits also make it easier to collaborate with other developers by allowing them to see the changes made to the codebase and understand the reasoning behind those changes.

Git provides several commands to work with commits, including:

* `git commit`: Creates a new commit with the changes that have been staged.

* `git log`: Displays a history of all the commits made to the codebase.

* `git diff`: Shows the changes made in a particular commit or between two commits.

* `git revert`: Reverts the changes made in a particular commit.
