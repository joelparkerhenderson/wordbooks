# Search algorithms

Search algorithms are used to find an element with a specific property within a collection of data. The most basic search algorithm is linear search, which sequentially checks every element in the collection until the desired element is found or the end of the collection is reached. However, linear search is not always the most efficient algorithm for large collections, so more advanced search algorithms have been developed.

One common type of search algorithm is binary search. This algorithm is only applicable to sorted collections, but it is much more efficient than linear search. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the collection in half until the desired element is found. At each step, the algorithm compares the target element to the middle element of the current range. If the target is smaller, the algorithm repeats the search on the left half of the range. If the target is larger, the algorithm repeats the search on the right half of the range. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the collection.

Another common type of search algorithm is interpolation search. This algorithm is similar to binary search, but it is more efficient for collections with uniformly distributed elements. Interpolation search works by using the value of the target element and the values of the first and last elements in the collection to estimate the position of the target element. The algorithm then narrows the search range based on this estimate and continues with a binary search. Interpolation search has a time complexity of O(log log n) for uniformly distributed data and O(n) in the worst case.

Other types of search algorithms include exponential search, jump search, and Fibonacci search. Exponential search works by first finding a range that contains the target element using exponential increments, and then performing a binary search within that range. Jump search works by first dividing the collection into blocks of a fixed size, and then jumping through these blocks until the desired element is found. Fibonacci search is similar to binary search, but it uses Fibonacci numbers to determine the size of the search range at each step.

The choice of search algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the data being searched and the performance requirements of the application.
