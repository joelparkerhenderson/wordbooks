# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) is a United States (U.S.) federal law designed to increase corporate accountability and transparency, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures. SOX applies to all U.S. publicly traded companies, and to foreign companies that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and have securities listed on U.S. exchanges.

Key provisions:

* Corporate governance: SOX requires that public companies have an independent board of directors and establish audit committees composed of independent members. The CEO and CFO are required to certify the accuracy of financial statements.

* Financial reporting: SOX requires that public companies disclose all material information in their financial reports, and that their financial statements are accurate and complete.

* Internal controls: SOX requires that public companies establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting to ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial statements.

* Whistleblower protections: SOX provides protections for employees who report accounting fraud, securities violations, or other types of misconduct.

* Penalties: SOX imposes severe penalties on companies and executives who engage in financial fraud or other types of misconduct, including fines and imprisonment.

SOX has had a significant impact on corporate governance in the U.S. SOX led to increased transparency and accountability, and helped restore investor confidence. However, SOX has been criticized for being burdensome and costly for companies, particularly smaller ones, and for creating a compliance-focused culture that distracts from more-important priorities.
