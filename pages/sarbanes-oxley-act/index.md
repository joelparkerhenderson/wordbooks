# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) is a federal law enacted in 2002 in response to a series of financial scandals that rocked the corporate world, most notably the Enron scandal. The law is designed to increase corporate accountability and transparency, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures. SOX applies to all publicly traded companies in the United States, as well as to foreign companies that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and have securities listed on U.S. exchanges.

The key provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include:

* Corporate governance: SOX requires that public companies have an independent board of directors and establish audit committees composed of independent members. The CEO and CFO are also required to certify the accuracy of financial statements.

* Financial reporting: SOX requires that public companies disclose all material information in their financial reports, and that their financial statements are accurate and complete.

* Internal controls: SOX requires that public companies establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting to ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial statements.

* Whistleblower protections: SOX provides protections for employees who report accounting fraud, securities violations, or other types of misconduct.

* Penalties: SOX imposes severe penalties on companies and executives who engage in financial fraud or other types of misconduct, including fines and imprisonment.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has had a significant impact on corporate governance and financial reporting in the United States. It has led to increased transparency and accountability in the corporate world, and has helped to restore investor confidence in the integrity of financial markets. However, it has also been criticized for being overly burdensome and costly for companies, particularly smaller ones, and for creating a compliance-focused culture that may distract from other important business priorities.
