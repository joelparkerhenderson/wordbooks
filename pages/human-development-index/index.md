# Human Development Index

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to measure a country's overall level of human development. The HDI takes into account three dimensions of human development: health, education, and standard of living. These dimensions are measured using indicators such as life expectancy, education level, and income per capita.

The HDI was first introduced in the 1990 Human Development Report published by the UNDP. It was developed as an alternative to more traditional measures of economic development such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, which fail to take into account non-economic factors such as health and education. The HDI is intended to provide a more comprehensive measure of a country's development that reflects the well-being of its citizens.

The health component of the HDI is measured by life expectancy at birth. The education component is measured by a combination of two indicators: expected years of schooling and mean years of schooling. The standard of living component is measured by gross national income (GNI) per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Each of these three dimensions is given equal weight in the calculation of the HDI. Countries are then ranked according to their HDI score, with a maximum score of 1.0 (indicating the highest level of human development) and a minimum score of 0.0 (indicating the lowest level of human development). The HDI is often used by governments, international organizations, and researchers as a measure of progress in human development over time and across countries.
