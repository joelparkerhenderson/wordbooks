# Product discovery

Product discovery is the process by which startups identify, define, and refine the features and functions of their product or service. The goal is to create a product that solves a real problem for customers and is easy and intuitive to use.

1. Identify the problem that your product or service will solve. This may involve conducting market research, talking to potential customers, or analyzing existing solutions in the market.

2. Define the user personas that your product will target. User personas are fictional representations of your ideal customers, and they can help you understand the needs, goals, and pain points of your target audience.

3. Brainstorm potential solutions to the problem, taking into account the needs and goals of your user personas. Consider different approaches and features that could solve the problem. Evaluate each solution based on its feasibility, desirability, and viability.

4. Prioritize the features and functions that you want in your product. This may involve conducting more user research to understand which features are most important to your target audience, or using a prioritization framework such as the MoSCoW method.

5. Create prototypes to test with potential customers. This may involve low-fidelity wireframes or mockups, or developing a high-fidelity working prototype of your product.

6. Test and iterate: Test your prototypes with potential customers, and gather feedback on their usability, functionality, and overall appeal. Use this feedback to refine your product and iterate on your design.

7. Develop a product roadmap: Once you have a clear understanding of your product's features and functionality, develop a product roadmap. This may include milestones, timelines, and priorities for future features and enhancements.
