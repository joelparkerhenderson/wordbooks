2. Build Relationships: Establish trust and credibility, and knowledge of the customer's business. Develop a comprehensive tailored plan for the customer, based on the customer's goals, market trends, competitive landscape, and capabilities.

3. Collaborate: Work with internal departments, such as sales, marketing, product development, customer support, and operations. Leverage the organization's expertise, resources, and capabilities to meet the specific needs of key accounts. 

4. Deliver Vaule: Define success metrics to assess the organization's performance, identify opportunities for improvement, and show impact. Data-driven approaches strengthen the account's trust and confidence in the organization.

5. Managing Risk: Identify and mitigate any risks, challenges, or threats with accounts. Ensure the continuity and resilience of the account partnership.

6. Manage: Maximize customer lifetime value via contract renewals, upselling, and cross-selling. Consistently demonstrate value. Proactively identify opportunities for account growth, such as expansion into new business units or geographical regions. Collaborate to capitalize on these opportunities.
