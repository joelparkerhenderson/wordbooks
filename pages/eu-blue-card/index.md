# EU Blue Card 

The European Union Blue Card is a residence and work permit that allows highly skilled non-European Union citizens to live and work in participating EU member states. It is designed to attract and retain highly qualified professionals from around the world, contributing to the economic growth and competitiveness of the European Union. 

* Eligibility Criteria: Applicants must meet certain criteria, which typically include: a. Holding a valid job offer or employment contract from a company or organization in an EU member state; b. Possessing a higher education degree or equivalent qualifications; c. Meeting minimum salary requirements, which vary depending on the country and profession.

* Application Process: Applicants must apply for the EU Blue Card in the country where they intend to work, and submit various documents, such as an employment contract, proof of qualifications, and proof of health insurance.

* Duration and Renewal: The EU Blue Card is initially issued for a period of one to four years, depending on the country. During that time, individuals may have the opportunity to apply for long-term residence.

* Benefits and Rights: The EU Blue Card provides several benefits and rights to the cardholder, which may include: a. Right to live and work in the EU member state that issued the Blue Card; b. Possibility to bring family members (spouse and minor children) to the EU and provide them with residence permits; c. Access to social security benefits, healthcare, and education services; d. Freedom of movement within the participating EU member states after residing in the issuing country for a certain period; e. Certain rights related to employment, such as equal treatment, working conditions, and professional mobility.

* Job Mobility: A significant advantage of the EU Blue Card is the ability to change jobs within the participating EU member states, within restrictions.

* Dependent Family Members: EU Blue Card holders can bring their dependent family members, including spouses and minor children, to reside with them in the EU member state. 

* Recognition of Qualifications: EU member states generally recognize higher education degrees and professional qualifications obtained in other EU member states.
