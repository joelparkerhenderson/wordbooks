# Internationalization and Localization - steps

Internationalization generally uses these steps:

* Planning and Analysis: This involves defining the scope of the internationalization effort, identifying the target markets, and analyzing the cultural and linguistic requirements of those markets. It also involves assessing the existing software or product design for potential internationalization issues.

* Design and Development: The next step is to design and develop the product or software using best practices for internationalization. This includes ensuring that the product can handle various character sets, date and time formats, and other regional differences.

Localization generally uses these steps:

* Translation: The first and most important step in localization is translation. All text, audio, and video content must be translated into the language of the target market.

* Cultural adaptation: Localization also involves adapting the content to the culture of the target market. This includes adapting images, symbols, colors, and other visual elements to be more appropriate for the target market.

* Formatting: Text may need to be reformatted to accommodate different character sets or writing systems. Dates, times, and other information may also need to be presented in a different format.

Both use these steps:

* Testing: After the software has been internationlized and localized, then it must be tested in each target culture.

* Deployment and Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance and support are provided to ensure that the product continues to meet the needs of the target market.
