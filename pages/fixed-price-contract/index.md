# Fixed-price contract

A fixed-price contract is a type of contract in which a buyer agrees to pay a seller a predetermined price for a specific product or service. The price remains fixed, regardless of any changes in the seller's costs, profits, or other factors that may affect the seller's expenses.

This is for projects with well-defined requirements and scope, where the buyer can accurately estimate the costs and the seller can provide a competitive price for the work. The seller bears the risk of any cost increases or overruns.

There are several types:

* Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Contract: In this type of contract, the seller agrees to deliver the product or service at a fixed price, regardless of the actual costs incurred. The seller assumes all the risks associated with the project, including cost overruns, delays, and other unforeseen events.

* Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment (FPEPA) Contract: This type of contract is used when there is a possibility of significant changes in the seller's costs over time. The contract includes a mechanism for adjusting the price based on changes in the seller's costs due to specific economic factors such as inflation, changes in labor rates, or changes in material costs.

* Fixed-Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Contract: This type of contract includes a fixed price and an incentive fee that is paid to the seller if certain performance targets are met. The incentive fee provides an additional reward to the seller for delivering the project on time, under budget, or meeting other performance targets.

For buyers, fixed-price contracts provide cost certainty, which helps them budget for the project and manage their financial risks. For sellers, fixed-price contracts offer a predictable revenue stream and provide an incentive to control costs and deliver the project on time.
