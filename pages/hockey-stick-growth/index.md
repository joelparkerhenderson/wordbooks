# Hockey-stick growth

Hockey-stick growth is a term used to describe a particular type of exponential growth that resembles the shape of a hockey stick. It is commonly used in business and entrepreneurship to describe the rapid and sustained growth of a company's revenue or user base over time.

The concept of hockey-stick growth is based on the idea that a business may initially experience slow growth or even a decline in growth during its early stages, but eventually reaches a point where its growth rate suddenly accelerates, leading to a dramatic increase in revenue or user base.

Hockey-stick growth is often associated with startups and emerging companies, as they are typically the ones that experience the most rapid growth due to their innovative ideas, market disruption, and agility. This type of growth is seen as highly desirable, as it can lead to a significant increase in a company's valuation and attract investor interest.

However, achieving hockey-stick growth is not easy and requires a combination of factors, including a solid business model, a product or service that solves a real problem, a clear value proposition, effective marketing and sales strategies, and a team capable of executing on the company's vision. Companies that fail to achieve hockey-stick growth may experience stagnation or decline, which can result in a loss of market share and competitiveness.
