# “Start Something That Matters” by Blake Mycoskie

"Start Something That Matters" is a book written by Blake Mycoskie, the founder of TOMS Shoes. In the book, Mycoskie shares his personal journey and the lessons he learned while building TOMS, a company that pioneered the "one for one" business model, where every pair of shoes sold, a pair of shoes is donated to a child in need.

The book is divided into two parts. The first part tells the story of how Mycoskie started TOMS, the challenges he faced, and the lessons he learned along the way. He shares how he was inspired by his travels to Argentina and witnessed the hardship that children faced, leading him to create a business that could help those in need. He also explains how he developed the "one for one" business model and how he was able to scale TOMS into a successful company.

The second part of the book is dedicated to helping readers start their own business that has a social impact. Mycoskie shares his advice on how to identify a social problem, come up with a business idea, and create a successful company that has a positive impact on society. He also provides practical tips on how to finance a social enterprise, build a team, and scale the business.

One of the key themes of the book is the importance of creating a business that aligns with your personal values and beliefs. Mycoskie encourages readers to think deeply about their own passions and interests and find a way to create a business that reflects those values. He emphasizes the importance of being authentic and transparent in business, which he believes will help attract customers and build a loyal following.
