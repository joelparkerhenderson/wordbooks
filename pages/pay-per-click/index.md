# Pay-per-click (PPC)

Pay-per-click (PPC) is a type of online advertising in which advertisers pay a fee each time a user clicks on one of their ads. PPC ads are commonly seen on search engines and social media platforms, where advertisers bid on specific keywords or target specific demographics in order to display their ads to the most relevant audience.

PPC advertising allows advertisers to reach potential customers more quickly and efficiently than traditional advertising methods, as they only pay for clicks on their ads, rather than impressions or views. Additionally, PPC advertising allows for more precise targeting and tracking of ad performance, making it easier for businesses to optimize their advertising campaigns and achieve a higher return on investment.

There are several different types of PPC advertising, including search advertising, display advertising, and social media advertising. Search advertising involves bidding on keywords and displaying text ads on search engine results pages. Display advertising involves placing banner or text ads on websites that are part of an advertising network. Social media advertising involves placing ads on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

PPC advertising can be an effective tool for businesses of all sizes to increase brand visibility, drive traffic to their websites, and generate leads or sales. However, it requires careful planning, research, and management to ensure that ad spend is being used effectively and efficiently.
