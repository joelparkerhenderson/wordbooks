# Value Stream Mapping (VSM)

Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a lean manufacturing technique used to analyze, visualize, and improve the flow of materials and information through a process. The value stream is defined as the sequence of activities required to transform raw materials or information into a finished product or service that is of value to the customer. 

Creating this involves several steps:

1. Define the scope: Define the boundaries of the process or value stream being analyzed. Identify the start and end points of the process, as well as the inputs and outputs.

2. Map the current state: Create a visual representation of the current process, including all the steps, the time required to complete each step, and the value added by each step. This map helps to identify areas of waste and inefficiency.

3. Analyze the current state: Analyze areas of waste and inefficiency. Look for opportunities to eliminate waste, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.

* Design the future state. Based on the analysis, design a future state map that represents an ideal process. Include all the changes and improvements that have been identified to eliminate waste, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.

* Implement the changes. This may involve streamlining the process, reorganizing resources, training employees, and implementing new processes and procedures.

The process of creating a value stream map involves collaboration between all stakeholders in the process, including operators, supervisors, and management, which helps to build consensus and support for the changes that are needed to improve the process.
