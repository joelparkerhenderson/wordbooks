# Service Obtainable Market (SOM)

Service Obtainable Market (SOM) is the portion of the Service Addressable Market (SAM) that a company can realistically capture and serve with its offerings given its business model, resources, and competitive environment. It represents the share of the market that the company can realistically expect to capture based on its current capabilities and market conditions.

In other words, the SOM is the portion of the SAM that a company can realistically obtain based on its ability to successfully compete in the market. This includes factors such as the company's sales and marketing capabilities, distribution channels, pricing strategy, product differentiation, and customer loyalty.

To calculate the SOM, companies typically begin with an estimate of the total market opportunity (TAM), which represents the total potential demand for their offerings in the market. They then narrow down the TAM to the Service Addressable Market (SAM), which represents the portion of the TAM that is relevant to the company's offerings and target customers. Finally, they estimate the SOM by taking into account their ability to compete in the market and capture a share of the SAM.

The SOM is an important metric for companies because it helps them set realistic sales goals, allocate resources effectively, and monitor their progress over time. By understanding the SOM, companies can develop targeted sales and marketing strategies that are tailored to their specific market position and competitive environment.

It's worth noting that the SOM is not a fixed figure and can vary over time as market conditions and competitive dynamics change. Therefore, it's important for companies to regularly reassess their SOM and adjust their strategies as needed to stay competitive and capitalize on emerging opportunities.
