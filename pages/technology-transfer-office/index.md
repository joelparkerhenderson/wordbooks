# Technology Transfer Office (TTO)

A Technology Transfer Office (TTO) is a department within a university, government agency, or research institute that is responsible for managing the intellectual property (IP) resulting from research and development (R&D) activities. The TTO's primary goal is to ensure that the discoveries and inventions arising from the research activities of the institution are used for the benefit of society. 

TTOs are typically involved in:

* Patenting: Identify patentable inventions and filing patent applications to protect them. This involves working with inventors to determine the scope of the invention, drafting patent applications, and managing the patent prosecution process.

* Licensing: License the technology to industry partners who can further develop and commercialize it. This involves negotiating licensing agreements, setting licensing terms, and monitoring compliance with licensing agreements.

* Startups: Work with inventors to form start-up companies to commercialize their inventions. This involves providing support and advice on business development, funding, and intellectual property management.

* Marketing: Promote the institution's technologies to potential industry partners, investors, and other stakeholders. 

* Outreach: Provide education and training to researchers on intellectual property management, entrepreneurship, and technology transfer.
