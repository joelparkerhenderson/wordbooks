# Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a type of access control system where an object's owner has the ability to control who can access the object and what actions they can perform on it. It is a commonly used access control mechanism in computer systems and networks.

In a DAC system, the owner of an object is given complete control over the access permissions of that object. The owner can choose who can access the object and what operations they are allowed to perform. This is in contrast to Mandatory Access Control (MAC), where access permissions are determined by a centralized security policy and not by the object's owner.

DAC is a flexible access control mechanism that allows users to manage their own resources. For example, a user can decide who is allowed to access their files on a computer or who is allowed to read or modify their documents on a shared network drive. However, this flexibility comes with a drawback as it may lead to security vulnerabilities if an object owner grants access to unauthorized individuals or if they are careless with their access permissions.

In a DAC system, access control lists (ACLs) are used to specify the access permissions for an object. An ACL contains a list of users or groups that are authorized to access the object, along with the specific permissions that they are allowed to perform. When a user attempts to access the object, the system checks the ACL to determine if the user has the necessary permissions to access it.

DAC is a commonly used access control mechanism that provides flexibility and control to object owners. However, it is important to use DAC in conjunction with other security measures to ensure the overall security of a system or network.
