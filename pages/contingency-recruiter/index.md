# Contingency recruiter

A contingency recruiter is a type of recruiting agency that is only paid a fee if they successfully place a candidate in a job. Unlike a retained search firm, which receives a portion of the fee upfront and the remainder when the placement is made, a contingency recruiter only gets paid when the client company hires a candidate they have sourced.

Contingency recruiting is often used by companies that are seeking to fill mid-level positions or roles that are more transactional in nature. These positions may not require the same level of specialization as executive-level positions, and the pool of qualified candidates is often larger.

Contingency recruiters typically work quickly to fill positions, as they are competing against other firms and in-house recruiters. They may source candidates through a variety of channels, including job boards, social media, and their own networks. Once they have identified a potential candidate, they will typically screen them to ensure that they meet the qualifications and requirements for the position.

If the candidate is deemed a good fit, the contingency recruiter will then present them to the client company. If the company decides to hire the candidate, the contingency recruiter will receive a percentage of the candidate's first-year salary as their fee. If the candidate is not hired, the recruiter does not receive any payment for their services.

While contingency recruiting can be a cost-effective way for companies to fill positions, it does come with some risks. Because the recruiter is only paid if the candidate is hired, they may be incentivized to push less qualified candidates in order to increase their chances of success. Additionally, because they are working on a deadline, they may not have as much time to thoroughly vet candidates or develop long-term relationships with their clients.
