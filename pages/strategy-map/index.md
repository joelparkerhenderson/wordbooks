# Strategy map

A strategy map is a visual representation of a company's strategy and objectives. It is designed to help organizations define and communicate their strategic goals, align their resources, and monitor their progress towards achieving those goals.

At its core, a strategy map is a tool for communicating how an organization's strategic objectives relate to each other and to the organization's overall mission and vision. It typically consists of a hierarchical structure, with the organization's mission and vision at the top, followed by strategic themes or objectives that support the mission and vision. These objectives are broken down further into more specific goals or initiatives, which are then linked to specific performance measures or key performance indicators (KPIs).

The purpose of a strategy map is to help organizations:

* Communicate their strategy: A strategy map provides a clear and concise way to communicate an organization's strategic goals and how they relate to each other. By presenting this information in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format, a strategy map can help ensure that everyone in the organization understands and is aligned with the overall strategy.

* Align resources: A strategy map can help organizations ensure that their resources, including people, processes, and technology, are aligned with their strategic objectives. By linking specific initiatives and KPIs to each objective, organizations can prioritize their resources and ensure that they are focused on the most important strategic goals.

* Monitor progress: A strategy map can help organizations track their progress towards achieving their strategic objectives. By monitoring specific KPIs and measuring progress against predefined targets, organizations can identify areas where they are succeeding and areas where they need to improve.
