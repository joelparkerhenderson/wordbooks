# Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security standards established by major credit card companies, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and JCB, to ensure that merchants and service providers who handle cardholder data are protecting it in a secure manner.

PCI DSS applies to any organization that accepts, processes, stores, or transmits credit card data, regardless of their size or location. The standard includes 12 requirements that are designed to ensure the security of cardholder data:

* Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.

* Do not use default passwords and security parameters provided by the vendors.

* Protect stored cardholder data.

* Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.

* Use and regularly update anti-virus software.

* Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.

* Restrict access to cardholder data to only those who need it to perform their job duties.

* Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.

* Restrict physical access to cardholder data.

* Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.

* Regularly test security systems and processes.

* Maintain a policy that addresses information security.

The requirements are divided into six categories, including build and maintain a secure network, protect cardholder data, maintain a vulnerability management program, implement strong access control measures, regularly monitor and test networks, and maintain an information security policy.

Merchants and service providers must meet all 12 requirements to be compliant with the standard. Compliance can be achieved through self-assessment or by engaging with a qualified security assessor (QSA) to conduct a formal audit.

PCI DSS compliance is mandatory and failure to comply can result in fines, increased transaction fees, and the loss of the ability to process credit card payments. Additionally, data breaches resulting from non-compliance can cause damage to the reputation of the affected organization and result in legal action by customers and regulatory authorities.
