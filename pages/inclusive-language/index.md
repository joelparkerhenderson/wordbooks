# Inclusive language

Inclusive language is language that is consciously chosen and used to avoid words, phrases, and expressions that marginalize or exclude individuals or groups of people based on their gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics. The goal of inclusive language is to promote diversity, equity, and inclusivity in communication and to create a more respectful and welcoming environment for all individuals.

Inclusive language involves both using words that are inclusive and avoiding words that are exclusive or offensive. Some examples of inclusive language include: gender-inclusive terms such as "everyone" instead of "ladies and gentlement", orientation-inclusive terms such as "partner" instead of "boyfriend" or "girlfriend", accountability-inclusive terms such as "our practices" instead of "best practices", group-respecting terms such as "accept/reject" instead of "whitelist/blacklist", etc.

There are many benefits to using inclusive language, including:

* Promoting inclusivity: Inclusive language helps to create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued, regardless of their background or identity.

* Reducing bias: Using inclusive language can help to reduce unconscious bias and stereotypes.

* Improving communication: Inclusive language can improve communication by ensuring that everyone understands and feels included in the conversation.

* Increasing understanding: Using inclusive language can help to increase understanding and respect for different cultures, backgrounds, and identities.

* Building trust: Inclusive language can help to build trust and foster positive relationships among individuals and groups.
