# Sales funnel

A sales funnel, also known as a purchase funnel, is a visual representation of the customer journey from the initial contact with a business or product to the final purchase. The purpose is to understand and optimize the customer journey

The typical sales funnel consists of four stages:

1. Awareness: Potential customers become aware of your product or service. This may happen through advertising, social media, or other marketing channels. The goal of this stage is to capture the attention of potential customers and encourage them to learn more about your product or service.

2. Interest: Potential customers begin to show interest in your product or service. They may visit your website, read blog posts, or engage with your social media accounts. The goal of this stage is to provide valuable information to potential customers and encourage them to engage further with your business.

3. Decision: Potential customers begin to consider making a purchase. They may request a quote, sign up for a free trial, or contact your sales team for more information. The goal of this stage is to provide potential customers with the information they need to make a decision and to address any concerns or objections they may have.

4. Action: Potential customers become paying customers. They may make a purchase, sign up for a subscription, or become a client. The goal of this stage is to make it as easy as possible for potential customers to complete the purchase process and to encourage them to become repeat customers.
