# The Cathedral and the Bazaar

"The Cathedral and the Bazaar" is an influential essay written by Eric Steven Raymond, which was first published in 1997. The essay provides a comparison between two models of software development, namely the "cathedral" model and the "bazaar" model.

The cathedral model of software development is based on a hierarchical structure, with a centralized and tightly controlled development process. The development team operates like an exclusive club, with limited access to the codebase and a small number of developers who are responsible for the overall direction of the project. The goal of the cathedral model is to produce a stable and reliable product, with a focus on quality assurance and long-term planning.

The bazaar model of software development is more decentralized and open. The development process is more like a bazaar, with many developers contributing code and ideas to the project. There is no central authority or top-down control, and the community is free to experiment with different features and approaches. The goal of the bazaar model is to create an innovative and flexible product that can quickly respond to changing demands.

Raymond argues that the bazaar model of software development is more effective than the cathedral model. The bazaar model has several advantages, such as the ability to harness the collective creativity and intelligence of a large number of developers, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing needs and requirements. The bazaar model is also more inclusive, as it encourages participation from a wide range of developers and users, resulting in a more diverse and engaged community.
