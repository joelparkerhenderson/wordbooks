# Five Forces analysis

The Five Forces analysis is a business framework developed by Michael Porter. This framework is used to analyze the competitive landscape of an industry, and the competitive dynamics that shape profitability.

The five forces are:

1. Threat of New Entrants: This factor refers to the level of competition in the industry and the ease of entry for new businesses. A high level of competition and a low barrier to entry can make it difficult for businesses to succeed.

2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Refers to the power that suppliers have over the businesses they supply. Suppliers with significant bargaining power can raise prices, which can decrease profit margins.

3. Bargaining Power of Buyers: Refers to the power that buyers have over businesses. Buyers with significant bargaining power can negotiate lower prices, which can decrease profit margins for businesses.

4. Threat of Substitutes: Refers to the potential for substitutes to enter the market and compete with existing businesses. If there are many substitutes available, businesses may need to compete on price, which can decrease profit margins.

5. Intensity of Rivalry: Refers to the level of competition among existing businesses in the industry. If there are many competitors, businesses may need to compete on price, which can decrease profit margins.

By analyzing these five factors, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of competitive dynamics, and develop strategies to address them. For example, if there is a high threat of new entrants, a business could invest in brand positioning. Similarly, if the bargaining power of buyers is high, a business could invest in stronger relationships with customers to improve loyalty.
