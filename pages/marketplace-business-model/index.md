# Marketplace business model

The marketplace business model is a type of business model that connects buyers and sellers on a single platform, allowing them to transact with each other. The marketplace operator typically generates revenue by charging a commission or transaction fee on each sale made through the platform.

The marketplace business model typically involves several key components:

* Platform: The marketplace operator provides a platform that connects buyers and sellers. This platform can take various forms, such as a website, mobile app, or software platform.

* Listings: Sellers list their products or services on the platform, providing details such as price, product description, and images.

* Search and discovery: Buyers can search for products or services on the platform using keywords or filters, and the platform provides search results based on relevance.

* Transactions: Buyers can purchase products or services directly from sellers through the platform. The platform typically facilitates the transaction, providing tools such as payment processing and shipping integration.

* Commission or transaction fees: The marketplace operator charges a commission or transaction fee on each sale made through the platform. This fee can be a percentage of the sale price or a flat fee per transaction.
