# Market estimation

Market estimation is a process of determining the potential market size and demand for a product or service in a particular industry or geographic location. It is essential for any business to evaluate the potential demand for its offerings before entering a market to make informed decisions about investment, product development, and marketing strategies.

In market estimation, three primary measures are used to define market size and potential demand: Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM).

* Total Addressable Market (TAM): TAM represents the total demand for a product or service in a specific market or geographic location. It includes all potential customers who might benefit from the product or service. TAM is calculated by multiplying the estimated number of potential customers by the average revenue per customer.

* Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): SAM represents the portion of TAM that a business can realistically target and serve based on its resources and capabilities. SAM is a subset of TAM that considers the company's specific target market, the geography it serves, and the market segments it can reach.

* Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): SOM represents the portion of SAM that a business can realistically capture based on its marketing and sales efforts. SOM is a subset of SAM that considers the competition, the company's market share, and its sales and marketing strategies.

By estimating TAM, SAM, and SOM, businesses can better understand the potential market size, market penetration opportunities, and their share of the market. This information can help companies make informed decisions about product development, marketing strategies, pricing, and investment opportunities.
