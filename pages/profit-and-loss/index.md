# Profit and loss (P&L)

Profit and loss, also known as P&L, is a financial statement that summarizes a business's revenue, costs, and expenses over a period of time, typically a fiscal quarter or year.

The P&L statement starts with the business's revenue, which is the total amount of money earned from sales or services during the period. From there, the statement deducts the cost of goods sold (COGS), which includes the cost of materials, labor, and other expenses associated with producing or delivering the products or services. This results in the gross profit, which is the revenue minus the COGS.

Next, the statement deducts the business's operating expenses, such as rent, salaries, marketing expenses, and utilities. This results in the operating profit or loss, which is the gross profit minus the operating expenses. If the operating profit is positive, the business has made a profit. If it is negative, the business has made a loss.

Finally, the P&L statement takes into account non-operating items such as interest income, interest expense, gains or losses from the sale of assets, and income taxes. This results in the net profit or loss, which is the operating profit or loss plus or minus any non-operating items.

The P&L statement is an important tool for business owners, investors, and lenders, as it provides a snapshot of a company's financial health and performance over a specific period of time. By reviewing the P&L statement, stakeholders can evaluate a company's revenue growth, cost structure, and profitability.

It is important to note that the P&L statement does not provide a complete picture of a company's financial health, as it does not take into account factors such as cash flow, assets, and liabilities. It is therefore important to use the P&L statement in conjunction with other financial statements and metrics when evaluating a business's financial performance.
