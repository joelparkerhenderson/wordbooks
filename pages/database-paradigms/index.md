# Database paradigms

Database paradigms refer to the theoretical framework and concepts that govern how data is organized, stored, and accessed in a database management system (DBMS). There are several database paradigms, each with its own set of rules, models, and methods for managing data. Some of the commonly used database paradigms are:

* Relational database: A relational database organizes data into one or more tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. The relationship between the tables is established through primary keys and foreign keys. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manipulate the data in relational databases.

* Document-oriented database: A document-oriented database stores data in documents, such as using JSON format or XML format. This paradigm is used for managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media posts, blogs, and articles.

* Object-oriented database: In an object-oriented database, data is stored as objects, which can contain properties, methods, and relationships with other objects. This database paradigm is used to manage complex data structures, such as multimedia content and geographic information.

* Graph database: In a graph database, data is stored as nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between them. This database paradigm is used for managing complex, interconnected data, such as social networks and recommendation systems.

* Vector database: TODO

* Ledger database: TODO

* Time-series database: TODO


Each database paradigm has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of paradigm depends on the specific needs of the application.
