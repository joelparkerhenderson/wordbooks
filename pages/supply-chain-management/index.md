# Supply chain management (SCM)

Supply chain management (SCM) is the process of designing, planning, executing, controlling, and monitoring the flow of goods, services, and information from suppliers to customers. It encompasses sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, distribution, and customer service.

Key components of supply chain management:

* Supplier management: selecting and managing suppliers based on factors such as quality, cost, and reliability.

* Procurement: acquiring raw materials, goods, and services from suppliers in the most cost-effective manner.

* Production planning: coordinating production schedules and ensuring that production meets demand while minimizing inventory costs.

* Inventory management: managing inventory levels to ensure that there is sufficient stock to meet customer demand while minimizing excess inventory.

* Logistics: managing the transportation and distribution of goods and services across the global supply chain.

* Performance monitoring: monitoring key performance indicators such as on-time delivery, inventory turnover, and order accuracy to ensure that the global supply chain is operating effectively.

Effective SCM can provide numerous benefits to businesses, including:

* Improved efficiency: streamline supply chain operations, reducing costs and improving efficiency.

* Increased customer satisfaction: improve product quality, reduce lead times, and ensure on-time delivery, leading to increased customer satisfaction.

* Greater flexibility: respond to changing market conditions, such as fluctuations in demand or supply chain disruptions.

* Enhanced risk management: identify and mitigate supply chain risks, such as geopolitical instability or natural disasters.
