# Organizational values frameworks

Organizational values frameworks are sets of principles or guidelines that organizations use to establish their core values and ethical principles.

Some common organizational values frameworks:

* Code of ethics and code of conduct: These frameworks outline ethical principles and conduct principles that people are expected to uphold. These codes provide clear guidelines for behavior, expectations, escalations, and consquences.

* The membership values framework and leadership values framework: These frameworks define the values and behaviors that are expected of members and leaders of the organization. Typical examples involve collaboration, innovation, and excellence. These frameworks ensure that people are modeling the organization's values, and also increase accountability and transparency.

* The diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging (DEIB) framework: This framework typically includes principles such as respect, fairness, and participation. This helps ensure that the organization creates a welcoming supportive environment for everyone.

To effectively implement organizational values frameworks, organizations should involve employees and stakeholders in the process of defining and refining the frameworks. They should also ensure that the frameworks are aligned with the organization's mission and vision, and that they are communicated clearly and consistently throughout the organization. Additionally, organizations should regularly evaluate and update their values frameworks to ensure they are relevant and effective.
