Organizational values frameworks are sets of principles or guidelines that organizations use to establish their core values and ethical principles. These frameworks provide a foundation for organizational culture, decision-making, and behavior, and help to ensure that employees and stakeholders are aligned with the organization's mission and vision.

There are several common organizational values frameworks, including the following:

* Code of ethics: This framework outlines the ethical principles and standards that employees and stakeholders are expected to uphold. It provides a clear set of guidelines for behavior, and helps to promote accountability and transparency.

* Code of conduct: This framework outlines the conduct principles and standards that employees and stakeholders are expected to uphold. It provides a clear set of guidelines for behavior, and helps to promote accountability and transparency.

* The membership values framework: This framework defines the values and behaviors that are expected of members of the organization. Examples are collaboration, innovation, or excellence. It helps to shape organizational culture and ensure that employees are aligned with the organization's values.

* The leadership values framework: This framework defines the values and behaviors that are expected of leaders within the organization. It helps to ensure that leaders are modeling the organization's values and promoting a culture of accountability and transparency.

* The diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging (DEIB) framework: This framework focuses on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the organization. It includes principles such as respect, fairness, and inclusivity, and helps to ensure that the organization is creating a welcoming and supportive environment for all employees and stakeholders.

To effectively implement organizational values frameworks, organizations should involve employees and stakeholders in the process of defining and refining the frameworks. They should also ensure that the frameworks are aligned with the organization's mission and vision, and that they are communicated clearly and consistently throughout the organization. Additionally, organizations should regularly evaluate and update their values frameworks to ensure that they remain relevant and effective over time.
