# Organizational values frameworks

Organizational values frameworks are sets of principles or guidelines that organizations use to establish their core values and ethical principles. These frameworks provide a foundation for organizational culture, decision-making, and behavior, and help to ensure that employees and stakeholders are aligned with the organization's mission and vision.

Some common organizational values frameworks:

* Code of ethics and code of conduct: These frameworks outline the ethical principles and conduct principles that employees and stakeholders are expected to uphold. These must provide a clear set of guidelines for behavior, expectations, escalations, and consquences.

* The membership values framework and leadership values framework: These frameworks defines the values and behaviors that are expected of members and leaders of the organization. Examples are collaboration, innovation, or excellence. It helps to shape organizational culture, ensure that people are modeling the organization's values, and promote accountability and transparency.

* The diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging (DEIB) framework: This framework focuses on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the organization. It includes principles such as respect, fairness, and inclusivity, and helps to ensure that the organization is creating a welcoming and supportive environment for all employees and stakeholders.

To effectively implement organizational values frameworks, organizations should involve employees and stakeholders in the process of defining and refining the frameworks. They should also ensure that the frameworks are aligned with the organization's mission and vision, and that they are communicated clearly and consistently throughout the organization. Additionally, organizations should regularly evaluate and update their values frameworks to ensure that they remain relevant and effective over time.
