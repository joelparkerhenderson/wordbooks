# System testing 

System testing is a type of software testing that is used to evaluate and verify the entire system's behavior and functionality as a whole. This testing technique ensures that all the software components work together correctly and satisfy the system requirements. The objective of system testing is to identify defects and ensure that the system operates as expected.

The system testing process involves the following steps:

* Test planning: It involves creating a test plan that outlines the scope, objectives, and approach to testing. It includes identifying the resources required, test environment setup, and risk assessment.

* Test design: It involves developing test cases and test scenarios based on the system requirements, user stories, and use cases. The test cases should cover all the critical functionalities and use cases of the system.

* Test execution: It involves executing the test cases and recording the results. The testers should document the defects or issues found during the testing process.

* Defect tracking: It involves tracking and managing the defects found during testing. It includes assigning severity and priority levels to the defects, tracking their status, and ensuring they are resolved before release.

* Test closure: It involves analyzing the test results and preparing a test summary report. It includes highlighting the testing results, recommendations for improvement, and any lessons learned.

The types of tests performed during system testing include:

* Functional testing: It ensures that the system functions as per the requirements and specifications. It involves testing the inputs, processing, and outputs of the system.

* Performance testing: It tests the system's performance under normal and peak loads to ensure it meets the performance requirements.

* Security testing: It tests the system's security features and vulnerabilities to identify security loopholes and potential threats.

* Usability testing: It tests the system's user interface and user experience to ensure that the system is user-friendly and easy to use.

* Compatibility testing: It tests the system's compatibility with different hardware, software, and operating systems.

* Regression testing: It tests the system after making changes to ensure that existing functionality has not been affected.
