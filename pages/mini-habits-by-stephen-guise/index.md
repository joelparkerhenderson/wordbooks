# “Mini Habits” by Stephen Guise

Mini Habits is a book written by Stephen Guise that introduces a unique and effective approach to behavior change. The basic idea is to set small, easy-to-achieve goals, known as "mini habits," that require minimal willpower to complete, yet consistently build momentum toward larger goals.

Guise argues that traditional goal-setting strategies, which rely on motivation and willpower, often lead to failure and frustration. This is because they require significant effort and focus, which is difficult to sustain over time. Instead, he suggests that creating mini habits is a more effective way to create lasting change.

The book outlines the steps to creating mini habits, including choosing a simple, specific action that can be completed in less than two minutes, setting a goal of doing that action every day, and celebrating each success. The idea is that by making the goal so small and easy, it becomes almost effortless to complete, which creates a positive feedback loop of success and builds momentum toward larger goals.

The book also covers topics such as habit stacking, the power of self-talk, and the importance of self-compassion in creating lasting change. Overall, Mini Habits provides a practical and accessible approach to behavior change that can be applied to any area of life, from health and fitness to career and personal growth.
