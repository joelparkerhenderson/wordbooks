Founded in 2012, BGV focuses on supporting startups that aim to create positive social and environmental impact through technology and innovation. It provides funding, mentorship, and a structured program to help startups develop their ideas, scale their businesses, and make a meaningful difference in society.

Investment Focus: BGV invests in startups that address societal and environmental challenges using technology-driven solutions. The fund has a broad impact focus, encompassing areas such as health, education, climate change, sustainability, civic engagement, and social justice.

The program includes a combination of workshops, mentoring sessions, and networking opportunities designed to help startups refine their business models, develop their products, and prepare for growth and investment.

Investment and Support: Upon acceptance into the accelerator program, BGV provides startups with an initial investment, typically in the form of seed funding. The funding helps cover the startups' early-stage costs, including product development, market validation, and team building.

Impact Investing: Startups in the BGV portfolio are encouraged to track and assess the social and environmental impact of their products or services. BGV supports startups in integrating impact measurement frameworks into their operations, enabling them to understand and communicate their impact to stakeholders.

BGV's alumni network comprises a community of impact-driven entrepreneurs who continue to receive support and connections beyond the initial accelerator program.
