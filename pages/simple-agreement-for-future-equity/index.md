# Simple agreement for future equity (SAFE)

A Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) is an agreement where an investor provides capital to a startup in exchange for the right to convert the investment into equity in the future, typically during the next equity financing round.

The key feature of a SAFE is that it allows startups to raise capital without having to establish a valuation at the time of the investment. This can be advantageous for both the investor and the startup, as it enables the investor to participate in the potential upside of the company without having to make a specific valuation judgment, and it allows the startup to avoid the complications and expenses associated with a traditional equity financing round.

There are variations of the SAFE: a "pre-money" SAFE converts to equity before the next equity financing round, whereas a "post-money" SAFE converts to equity after the next equity financing round. Terms that can be negotiated include the conversion discount, which reduces the price at which the SAFE will convert to equity, and the valuation cap, which sets a maximum valuation for the conversion.

A potential disadvantage of using a SAFE is that it can create uncertainty for the startup and its investors regarding the future ownership structure of the company. If the startup does well and raises additional financing at a higher valuation, the dilution for the SAFE investor can be significant. Additionally, since a SAFE is not technically equity, it may not provide the same level of protection for investors as traditional equity instruments.

Despite these concerns, SAFEs have become a popular tool for startup financing, especially for early-stage companies that are not yet ready to establish a formal valuation. SAFEs provide a flexible and relatively simple way for startups to raise capital, and also give investors a sipmler way to participate.
