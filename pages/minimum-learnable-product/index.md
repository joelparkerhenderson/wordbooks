# Minimum learnable product (MLnP)

Minimum learnable product (MLnP) is a product development approach that focuses on creating the smallest possible version of a product that is still able to provide value to users while also teaching them how to use it effectively. The goal is to create a product that not only satisfies users' immediate needs but also helps them develop the skills and knowledge necessary to fully benefit from the product.

The MLnP approach is a variation of the minimum viable product (MVP) and minimum lovable product (MLP) approaches. While MVP focuses on creating the minimum set of features necessary to test a product idea and MLP focuses on creating a product that is emotionally engaging and lovable, MLnP emphasizes the importance of education and skill development.

To create an MLnP, product teams need to focus on understanding the key skills and knowledge that users need to effectively use the product. This may involve identifying common user pain points, conducting user research, and mapping out the user journey to identify key learning moments.

Once the key learning moments have been identified, product teams can work to create a product that not only satisfies users' immediate needs but also helps them develop the skills and knowledge necessary to use the product effectively. This may involve incorporating tutorials, tips, and other educational materials into the product, as well as designing the product in a way that guides users through the learning process.

Some key benefits of the MLnP approach include:

* Increased user engagement: By helping users develop the skills and knowledge necessary to use the product effectively, MLnP can increase user engagement and satisfaction, leading to higher retention rates and increased revenue.

* Reduced support costs: By designing the product in a way that teaches users how to use it effectively, product teams can reduce the need for customer support, which can lower costs and improve overall customer satisfaction.

* Increased product adoption: By providing users with a clear learning path, MLnP can help to overcome the initial learning curve that often comes with new products, leading to increased adoption and usage.
