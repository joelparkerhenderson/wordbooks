# Minimum Learnable Product (MLnP)

Minimum Learnable Product (MLnP) is a product development approach that focuses on creating the smallest possible version of a product that provides value to users while teaching them how to use it effectively. The goal is to help users develop the skills and knowledge necessary to fully benefit from the product.

The MLnP approach is a variation of the minimum viable product (MVP) and minimum lovable product (MLP) approaches. MVP creates the minimum set of features necessary to test a product idea. MLP creates a product that is emotionally engaging and lovable. MLnP emphasizes the importance of education and skill development.

To create an MLnP, product teams need to focus on understanding the key skills and knowledge that users need to effectively use the product. 

Once the key learning moments have been identified, product teams can create a product that satisfies users' immediate needs plus helps them develop skills to use the product effectively. This may involve tutorials, tips, and other educational materials, as well as designing the product in a way that guides users through the learning process.

Some key benefits of the MLnP approach include:

* Increased user engagement: By helping users develop skills to use the product effectively, MLnP can increase user engagement and satisfaction, leading to higher retention rates and increased revenue.

* Reduced support costs: By designing the product in a way that teaches users how to use it effectively, product teams can reduce the need for customer support, which can lower costs and improve satisfaction.

* Increased product adoption: By providing users with a clear learning path, MLnP can help to overcome the initial learning curve, leading to increased adoption and usage.
