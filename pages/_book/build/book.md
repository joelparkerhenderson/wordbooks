# Vision, mission, values 

Vision, mission, and values are three key components of a company's overall strategic plan. They represent the company's purpose, direction, and guiding principles, respectively. Here is a more detailed explanation of each component:

* Vision: A company's vision is its overarching goal or aspiration. It is a statement that describes what the company hopes to achieve in the long term. A good vision statement should be inspiring, future-oriented, and succinct. It should provide a clear sense of direction and purpose for the company's employees and stakeholders.

* Mission: A company's mission is its reason for being. It is a statement that describes what the company does, who it serves, and how it does it. A good mission statement should be customer-focused, specific, and action-oriented. It should explain how the company adds value to its customers and what sets it apart from competitors.

* Values: A company's values are its guiding principles. They represent the company's beliefs and priorities, and they help to define the company's culture and behavior. A good set of values should be clear, concise, and meaningful. They should represent the company's highest aspirations and provide a framework for decision-making and behavior.

Together, a company's vision, mission, and values provide a roadmap for the company's overall strategy. They help to guide decision-making, inspire employees, and communicate the company's purpose and priorities to stakeholders. By articulating a clear and compelling vision, mission, and set of values, a company can differentiate itself from competitors and build a strong foundation for success.


# Vision statement

A vision statement is a statement that describes the desired future state or long-term goal of a business or organization. It is a statement of what the company wants to achieve, how it sees itself in the future, and what it hopes to accomplish. A vision statement is intended to inspire and motivate employees, customers, and other stakeholders, and to provide direction and focus for the company's strategy and operations.

A well-crafted vision statement typically includes the following elements:

1. Long-term goals: The statement should articulate the company's long-term goals, such as growth, profitability, or market leadership.

2. Aspirational: The statement should be aspirational and inspiring, capturing the company's highest aspirations and ambitions.

3. Future-oriented: The statement should be future-oriented, describing what the company hopes to achieve in the long-term.

4. Realistic: The statement should be realistic and achievable, taking into account the company's current capabilities, resources, and market conditions.

5. Unique: The statement should differentiate the company from its competitors, highlighting its unique strengths and advantages.

Here is an example of a vision statement from Microsoft: "Our vision is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more." This vision statement reflects Microsoft's long-term goal of empowering people and organizations, and its aspiration to be a force for positive change in the world. It is future-oriented, realistic, and inspiring, and it reflects the company's unique strengths in technology and innovation.

# Mission statement

A mission statement is a concise statement that describes the purpose and values of a business or organization. It serves as a guide for decision-making, provides direction for the company's strategy and operations, and communicates the company's values to stakeholders, such as employees, customers, investors, and partners.

A well-crafted mission statement typically includes the following elements:

1. Purpose: The statement should clearly articulate the company's reason for existence, what it hopes to accomplish, and why it matters.

2. Values: The statement should reflect the company's core values and principles, such as integrity, excellence, or innovation.

3. Target audience: The statement should identify the company's target audience, such as customers, investors, or employees, and what their needs or expectations are.

4. Distinctiveness: The statement should differentiate the company from its competitors and highlight its unique strengths and advantages.

Here is an example of a mission statement from Amazon: "Our vision is to be Earth's most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online." This mission statement clearly identifies Amazon's target audience, which is customers who want to buy products online. It also reflects the company's commitment to being customer-centric and its vision of being the best in the industry.

A well-crafted mission statement can help a business to align its strategy and operations with its core values and purpose. It can also serve as a tool for attracting and retaining customers, employees, and investors who share the company's values and vision.

# Values statement

A values statement is a concise, written declaration that communicates the core principles and beliefs that guide the behavior and decisions of a business. It is typically expressed in terms of the company's values and ideals, and provides a framework for how the organization conducts its affairs, interacts with stakeholders, and achieves its goals.

A values statement is different from a mission statement or a vision statement, which focus on the organization's purpose and aspirations, respectively. While a mission statement outlines what the business does and a vision statement describes where it wants to go, a values statement articulates the fundamental principles that drive how the business operates.

A well-crafted values statement typically includes a set of core values that reflect the company's culture and beliefs, and which serve as a guide for employees and other stakeholders. These values might include things like honesty, integrity, respect, teamwork, and customer focus. The statement should be specific and meaningful, and should reflect the unique identity and personality of the organization.

The values statement is an important tool for a business because it helps to define and communicate the organization's identity and purpose, and helps to align the behavior and decisions of employees with the company's goals and values. By establishing a clear set of values, businesses can create a shared sense of purpose and direction among employees, which can lead to increased motivation, engagement, and productivity. It can also help to build trust and credibility with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to ethical and responsible business practices.

# Startup discovery

Startup discovery is the process of exploring and validating a business idea before launching a startup. It involves conducting market research, identifying the target market and customer needs, and testing the product idea to determine if there is a viable business opportunity. The discovery phase typically consists of three main components: market discovery, customer discovery, and product discovery.

* Market discovery: This involves researching the market to determine the size and potential of the opportunity. The goal is to identify an attractive market that is large enough to support a successful business. Some of the key factors to consider during market discovery include the size of the market, the level of competition, the barriers to entry, and the market trends.

* Customer discovery: This involves identifying the target customer and understanding their needs and pain points. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the customer so that the product can be tailored to meet their needs. Some of the key factors to consider during customer discovery include the customer's demographics, behavior, preferences, and pain points.

* Product discovery: This involves testing the product idea to determine if there is a viable business opportunity. The goal is to create a product that meets the needs of the customer and solves a real problem. Some of the key factors to consider during product discovery include the product features, pricing, and positioning.

The startup discovery process is an iterative process that involves testing and refining the business idea until a viable opportunity is identified. By focusing on market discovery, customer discovery, and product discovery, entrepreneurs can increase their chances of success by developing a product that meets the needs of their target market.


# Market discovery 

Market discovery is the process by which startups identify and evaluate the size, viability, and potential of the market they are entering. The goal is to understand the market landscape and determine whether there is a viable market opportunity for the startup's product or service.

1. Identify the target market for your product or service. This may involve conducting market research to understand the size, demographics, and characteristics of your potential customers.

2. Conduct market analysis to evaluate the overall market landscape, including the size of the market, the competitive landscape, and any barriers to entry. This may involve analyzing market reports, conducting competitive research, or interviewing industry experts.

7. Develop a go-to-market strategy that outlines how you will bring your product to market. This may include your pricing strategy, distribution channels, marketing and advertising plans, and sales tactics.


# Market discovery questions

What problem does your product/service solve? How urgent or important is this problem for potential customers?

Who is your target customer? What are their demographics, interests, and pain points?

What other solutions are currently available on the market? How does your product/service differentiate from these options?

# Customer Discovery

Customer discovery is a process that helps startups gain a deep understanding of their potential customers in order to validate and refine their business idea. The process involves engaging with potential customers to understand their needs, preferences, and pain points, and to gather feedback on the startup's product or service. By understanding their customers' needs, startups can create a product that people will actually use and pay for, which is essential for the success of the business.

1. Identify your target customer segments, which are the groups of people who are most likely to be interested in your product or service. This may involve conducting market research to understand the size and characteristics of your potential customer segments.

2. Develop hypotheses about your customers' needs: Based on each target customer segment, develop hypotheses about their needs and pain points. These hypotheses will guide your customer discovery efforts.

3. Engage with potential customers, to validate your hypotheses and refine them. This may involve conducting surveys, interviews, or focus groups to gather feedback. 

4. Iterate and refine: Customer discovery is an iterative process, so use the feedback you gather to refine your product or service and test it with potential customers again. This may involve making changes to your product or service, your target customer segments, or your value proposition.

5. Develop a customer-centric mindset throughout your organization. By focusing on your customers' needs and preferences, you can create a product or service that truly meets their needs and stands out in the market.

# Product discovery

Product discovery is the process by which startups identify, define, and refine the features and functions of their product or service. The goal is to create a product that solves a real problem for customers and is easy and intuitive to use.

1. Identify the problem that your product or service will solve. This may involve conducting market research, talking to potential customers, or analyzing existing solutions in the market.

2. Define the user personas that your product will target. User personas are fictional representations of your ideal customers, and they can help you understand the needs, goals, and pain points of your target audience.

3. Brainstorm potential solutions to the problem, taking into account the needs and goals of your user personas. Consider different approaches and features that could solve the problem. Evaluate each solution based on its feasibility, desirability, and viability.

4. Prioritize the features and functions that you want in your product. This may involve conducting more user research to understand which features are most important to your target audience, or using a prioritization framework such as the MoSCoW method.

5. Create prototypes to test with potential customers. This may involve low-fidelity wireframes or mockups, or developing a high-fidelity working prototype of your product.

6. Test and iterate: Test your prototypes with potential customers, and gather feedback on their usability, functionality, and overall appeal. Use this feedback to refine your product and iterate on your design.

7. Develop a product roadmap: Once you have a clear understanding of your product's features and functionality, develop a product roadmap. This may include milestones, timelines, and priorities for future features and enhancements.

# Strategic effects

Strategic effects refer to the benefits that a company can achieve by making strategic decisions that improve its position in the market. These effects are achieved by implementing strategies that increase the company's competitive advantage, such as developing new products, improving customer service, or entering new markets.

One of the key strategic effects is the ability to generate higher profits. By implementing effective strategies, companies can increase their revenue and reduce their costs, resulting in higher profit margins. This, in turn, can lead to improved financial performance, increased investor confidence, and higher stock prices.

Another strategic effect is the ability to attract and retain customers. By providing high-quality products and services, companies can build a loyal customer base that will continue to support the company over the long term. This can result in increased sales, improved brand recognition, and higher market share.

Strategic effects can also help companies to stay ahead of their competitors. By developing innovative products, improving operational efficiency, and investing in research and development, companies can maintain a competitive edge and stay ahead of their rivals. This can help to increase market share and improve profitability.

Finally, strategic effects can help companies to achieve long-term sustainability.

This can result in increased customer loyalty, improved employee morale, and a better overall corporate image.


# Network effects

The network effect is a phenomenon in which the value of a product or service increases as the number of users or participants grows. In other words, the more people that use a product or service, the more valuable it becomes to each individual user. The network effect is often referred to as "Metcalfe's Law" after Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet.

The network effect can be seen in a variety of products and services, including social media platforms, communication tools, and marketplaces. This is because more users mean more content, more interactions, and more opportunities to connect with others.

The network effect can be broken down into two types:

1. Direct network effects: Direct network effects occur when the value of a product or service increases as more users join. Social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn are examples of products with direct network effects.

2. Indirect network effects: Indirect network effects occur when the value of a product or service increases as more complementary products or services are developed. For example, the value of a video game console like the Xbox or PlayStation increases as more game developers create games for the platform.

Network effects can create significant barriers to entry for competitors. When a product or service has a large user base, it can be difficult for competitors to gain a foothold in the market. This is because users are unlikely to switch to a new product or service that has a smaller user base and therefore less value.

The network effect can also create winner-takes-all markets, where one dominant player captures the majority of the market share. This is because the value of a product or service is directly tied to the number of users, so the largest player in the market has a significant advantage.


# Platform effects

The platform effect refers to the phenomenon where the value of a platform increases as more users and third-party developers join and contribute to the platform. In other words, the more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes to everyone involved.

This effect is most commonly associated with technology platforms, such as social media sites, mobile apps, and e-commerce marketplaces. For example, the more users join a social media site, the more attractive it becomes for advertisers to reach their target audience, which in turn attracts more users. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where the more popular the platform becomes, the more valuable it is to all users and stakeholders.

The platform effect is often cited as a key driver of network effects, which is the phenomenon where a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it. However, the platform effect also goes beyond the network effect, as it also includes the value created by third-party developers who build on the platform, creating complementary products and services that further increase the platform's value.

Platforms such as Apple's App Store, Amazon's Marketplace, and Google's Play Store are examples of platforms that have leveraged the platform effect to become dominant players in their respective markets. By building a platform that attracts a large user base and third-party developers, these companies have created ecosystems that are difficult for competitors to replicate.

To maximize the platform effect, companies must focus on creating a platform that is open and accessible to third-party developers, while also ensuring that the user experience is consistently excellent. They must also continue to innovate and evolve the platform to meet the changing needs of their users and stakeholders, and be responsive to feedback and concerns. By doing so, companies can create a platform that attracts a large and loyal user base, and creates value for everyone involved.


# Flywheel effects

The flywheel effect is a concept that describes how small, continuous efforts can lead to a compounding effect over time, resulting in significant progress and momentum. The idea is often used to describe the success of companies that have achieved sustained growth and competitive advantage.

The flywheel effect is based on the principle that every action taken can have a cumulative effect on overall performance. As a business continues to take actions that contribute to its success, the momentum builds, creating a positive feedback loop that reinforces and amplifies its efforts.

The flywheel effect can be broken down into four stages:

1. Start with small efforts. Focus on taking small, consistent actions that contribute to its goals. These actions might include building relationships with customers, improving product quality, or optimizing processes.

2. Increase momentum. This momentum can be thought of as the force that propels the flywheel forward.

3. Achieve breakthrough. When the business creates enough momentum, its efforts begin to pay off in a big way. This might mean achieving a significant increase in revenue or market share, or reaching a critical mass of customers.

4. Sustain success. Once the breakthrough has been achieved, continue consistent actions to sustain success. This ensures that the flywheel keeps spinning and the momentum is maintained.

The flywheel effect is often used to explain the success of companies like Amazon, which has built a powerful flywheel based on its customer-centric approach, low prices, and fast shipping. By continuously improving these areas, Amazon has created a feedback reinforcement cycle that has led to its dominance in e-commerce.


# Viral effects

In the context of business, "viral effects" refer to the phenomenon where a product or service spreads rapidly through word-of-mouth or other social sharing, similar to how a virus spreads. In other words, viral effects occur when customers become advocates for a product or service and share their positive experiences with others, leading to a self-sustaining cycle of growth and adoption.

Viral effects can be a powerful marketing tool for businesses, particularly those that operate online. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram provide a powerful way for customers to share their experiences with others and reach a broad audience. When customers share their positive experiences with a product or service on social media, it can quickly reach a large number of potential customers.

Viral effects can be amplified by various factors, such as having a product or service that is particularly innovative or unique, having a strong brand presence, or leveraging influencers to promote the product or service. Additionally, creating a strong community around the product or service can encourage customers to share their experiences with others and create a sense of belonging, which can lead to further adoption and growth.

However, it's important to note that viral effects can also work in reverse if customers have negative experiences with a product or service. In this case, negative word-of-mouth can spread just as quickly, potentially damaging the business's reputation and growth potential. Therefore, businesses need to focus on delivering high-quality products and services and providing excellent customer service to ensure positive experiences and minimize the risk of negative viral effects.

# Moat effects

In the world of business, a "moat" refers to a competitive advantage that a company has over its competitors. It can come in many forms, such as a strong brand, unique technology, a large user base, or exclusive access to resources. The idea is that a company with a strong moat is better positioned to defend its market position and generate sustainable profits over the long term.

Moats can have several positive effects for a company. Firstly, a strong moat can make it difficult for competitors to enter the market and compete with the company on an equal footing. This can help the company maintain higher profit margins and market share. Secondly, a strong moat can also make it easier for a company to expand into new markets and products, as it has a solid foundation to build upon. Finally, a strong moat can make a company more attractive to investors, as it suggests that the company has a long-term competitive advantage that will allow it to continue generating profits.

However, moats can also have negative effects. If a company relies too heavily on its moat, it may become complacent and fail to innovate, which could allow competitors to catch up and erode the moat. Additionally, a company with a strong moat may become too focused on defending its position, which could lead to missed opportunities for growth and expansion.

Overall, moats can be a powerful competitive advantage for companies, but they should be used strategically and balanced with a focus on innovation and growth.


# Scale effects

Scale effects refer to the impact that the size or scale of a business has on its costs, revenues, and profitability. When a business grows in size, it can benefit from various scale effects, such as economies of scale, network effects, and learning effects, which can lead to increased efficiency, lower costs, and higher profits.

Economies of scale are one of the most significant scale effects. They refer to the cost advantages that a business can achieve as it increases its production volume. As a business grows, it can spread its fixed costs over a larger output, leading to a decrease in average costs. For example, a factory that produces 10,000 units of a product per month may have a lower average cost per unit than a factory that produces only 1,000 units per month.

Network effects are another scale effect that can benefit a business as it grows. Network effects occur when the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. For example, social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn have a strong network effect because the more users they have, the more valuable they become to their users.

Learning effects refer to the improvement in productivity and efficiency that a business can achieve as it gains experience in producing a product or service. As a business becomes more experienced, it can improve its processes, reduce errors, and increase efficiency, leading to lower costs and higher profits.

In addition to these scale effects, there are other factors that can impact a business's profitability as it grows. For example, as a business becomes larger, it may face more competition, regulatory challenges, and operational complexity. Therefore, it is important for a business to manage these challenges effectively to ensure that it continues to benefit from scale effects and remains profitable as it grows.


# Leverage effects

Leverage effects refer to the impact of fixed costs on a company's profitability. Fixed costs are the expenses that remain constant regardless of the level of production or sales. Leverage effects can be positive or negative, depending on the level of sales and profits.

When a company has high fixed costs, it means that it has invested heavily in fixed assets such as equipment, buildings, and infrastructure. These costs do not vary with changes in sales volume, and as a result, the company has a higher break-even point. However, once the break-even point is reached, any additional revenue generated from sales will have a significant impact on profitability. This is because the company's fixed costs are spread over a larger number of units, resulting in lower unit costs and higher profits.

The positive leverage effect is often seen in capital-intensive industries such as manufacturing, where fixed costs account for a significant portion of total costs. In this scenario, an increase in sales volume can lead to significant increases in profits due to the lower unit costs associated with the spread of fixed costs over a larger number of units.

On the other hand, negative leverage effects can occur when a company has high fixed costs but experiences a decrease in sales volume. In this case, the company's fixed costs are spread over fewer units, resulting in higher unit costs and lower profits. Negative leverage effects are more common in industries with high fixed costs and low variable costs, such as airlines.

Leverage effects are important to consider when evaluating a company's financial performance, as they can have a significant impact on profitability and overall financial health. A company with high fixed costs should be aware of its break-even point and work to maintain sales volume above this level to maximize profits. Conversely, a company with high fixed costs may need to consider reducing expenses during periods of decreased sales volume to avoid negative leverage effects.


# Monopoly effects

Monopoly effects refer to the economic and social consequences of a market dominated by a single company or group. When a company holds a monopoly, it has complete control over the supply of a particular product or service and can charge high prices to consumers without fear of competition.

One of the primary negative effects of a monopoly is that it can lead to a lack of innovation. With no competition, the dominant company has little incentive to invest in research and development or to create new and improved products or services. This can result in a stagnation of the market, leaving consumers with limited choices and outdated offerings.

Monopolies also have the potential to exploit consumers by charging excessive prices or engaging in price discrimination. Without the check of competition, a monopolist can set prices at whatever level they choose, often resulting in higher costs for consumers. Additionally, monopolies can create barriers to entry for new competitors, which stifles innovation and can ultimately lead to reduced economic growth.

Another concern is the political power that monopolies may hold. With significant control over a market, a monopolist may be able to influence policy decisions, lobby lawmakers, and otherwise exert influence over the political process. This can lead to increased income inequality and reduced democratic representation.

Overall, while monopolies may be profitable for the companies that hold them, they can have significant negative effects on consumers, innovation, and economic growth. It is generally considered desirable to promote competition and prevent the formation of monopolies, either through government regulation or other means.


# Business models

A business model is a framework or plan that outlines how a business creates, delivers, and captures value for its customers. In essence, a business model describes how a company generates revenue and profits by outlining its key components, including the target customer segment, value proposition, revenue streams, cost structure, and key activities, resources, and partnerships needed to make the business work.

A well-defined business model is critical for any company, as it helps the business understand its market and competitive position, identify potential revenue streams, and allocate resources effectively. A strong business model provides a clear roadmap for the business to follow, allowing it to focus on its core strengths and identify new opportunities for growth.

There are many different types of business models, each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common business models include:

* Direct sales model: This model involves selling products or services directly to customers through a sales team or online platform.

* Subscription model: This model involves offering customers access to a product or service for a recurring fee, such as a subscription to a streaming service or a monthly box of curated products.

* Advertising model: This model involves generating revenue through advertising on a platform or website, such as through display ads, sponsored content, or affiliate marketing.

* Marketplace model: This model involves connecting buyers and sellers through a platform and taking a commission on each transaction, such as with online marketplaces like eBay or Etsy.

* Franchise model: This model involves licensing a business model to third-party operators who pay a fee for the right to use the brand name and operating system.


# Direct sales business model

The direct sales business model is when a company sells its products or services directly to customers, without involving a middleman or retailer. Typically a company sales team is responsible for building relationships with customers and generating revenue.

The model is often used by companies that have complex or high-value products or services that require a more personalized sales approach. For example, companies that sell high-end technology products or financial services often use this model because their products require a more in-depth understanding and explanation.

There are several key components of the direct sales business model:

* Sales team: The sales team is the primary driver of revenue in this model. They are responsible for building relationships with customers, identifying their needs, and offering solutions.

* Sales process: The sales process in a direct sales model is typically more complex than in other models. The sales team must go through steps to qualify leads, present offerings, and close deals.

* Compensation structure: The compensation structure for sales teams in a direct sales model is often commission-based, incentivizing close more deals, increasing revenue per deal, and achieving higher earnings.

* Customer relationship management: The direct sales model relies heavily on building strong relationships with customers. Companies need to invest in effective customer relationship management (CRM) systems to manage customer interactions.

* Training and development: Because the sales process is more complex in a direct sales model, companies need to invest in training and development programs to ensure their sales team has the necessary skills and knowledge to be successful.


# Direct sales business model pros/cons

The direct sales business model has several advantages for companies, including:

* Control over the sales process: By selling directly to customers, companies have more control over the sales process and can tailor their approach to meet the specific needs of their customers.

* Higher profit margins: Companies can earn higher profit margins by cutting out middlemen and retailers, which can help them achieve greater financial success.

* Customer insights: By building strong relationships with customers, companies can gain valuable insights into their needs, preferences, and behavior, which can inform future product development and marketing strategies.

The direct sales business model also has some disadvantages, including:

* High cost of sales: The sales process in a direct sales model can be costly and time-consuming, which can impact the company's bottom line.

* Risk of sales team turnover: Because sales teams are often commission-based, there is a risk of high turnover, which can disrupt the sales process and impact revenue.

* Limited scalability: The direct sales model can be difficult to scale, as the company must invest in additional sales resources to expand its reach and customer base.


# Subscription business model

The subscription business model is a type of business model in which customers pay a recurring fee in exchange for access to a product or service. This model has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in industries such as media, software, and consumer goods.

The subscription business model typically involves several key components:

* Value proposition: The value proposition of a subscription business is the product or service that is being offered to customers. It must be compelling enough to convince customers to pay a recurring fee.

* Subscription plans: Subscription businesses typically offer multiple subscription plans, each with different levels of access or features. For example, a software company may offer a basic plan with limited features and a premium plan with additional features.

* Payment model: The payment model for a subscription business is typically recurring, with customers paying a monthly or annual fee. Some businesses may also offer a pay-per-use model, in which customers pay based on their usage of the product or service.

* Retention strategy: Because customers are paying a recurring fee, subscription businesses must have a strong retention strategy to keep customers engaged and prevent churn. This may include offering exclusive content or features, providing excellent customer service, and optimizing the user experience.

* Acquisition strategy: Subscription businesses must also have a strong acquisition strategy to attract new customers and grow their customer base. This may include marketing campaigns, referral programs, and partnerships.
