# Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or system has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a particular action. In computer security, authorization is often used in conjunction with authentication, which is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system.

Authorization typically involves the use of access control mechanisms, such as permissions, roles, or other attributes, to restrict or grant access to specific resources or operations. These access control mechanisms may be implemented at various levels, such as operating system, application, or network.

One common approach to authorization is role-based access control (RBAC), which involves assigning users to specific roles and then defining the permissions associated with each role. Another approach is attribute-based access control (ABAC), which uses various attributes, such as user identity, location, time of day, and other factors, to determine access.

Authorization is an important aspect of security, as it helps ensure that sensitive resources and operations are only accessible to authorized users or systems. It is often implemented using a combination of technical controls, such as access control lists and firewalls, as well as administrative controls, such as policies and procedures for managing user access.
