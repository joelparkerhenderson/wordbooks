# Functional specifications 

Functional specifications are documents that describe the functional requirements of a software system or product. They outline what the system or product should do and how it should behave, in terms of its features, functionality, and user interactions.

Functional specifications typically include detailed descriptions of the user interface, inputs and outputs, data structures, algorithms, performance requirements, and other technical specifications. They also provide guidelines for how the system or product should handle errors, exceptions, and other unforeseen events.

Functional specifications are an important part of the project planning process because they provide a clear and detailed roadmap for the development team to follow. They help ensure that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the system or product requirements, which can help to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications. Additionally, they can serve as a basis for quality assurance testing and other project management activities.
