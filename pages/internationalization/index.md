# Internationalization (i18n)

Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing and developing software applications, websites, or products to make them adaptable to different cultures, regions, and languages without requiring major changes in the codebase. It involves developing products that can be easily localized, customized, and translated to meet the needs of users in different countries or regions.

The goal of internationalization is to create products that can be easily adapted to different markets, by taking into account the various cultural, linguistic, and technical requirements of those markets. This can include everything from localizing the user interface and content to adapting the product to comply with local regulations and standards.

Some common features of internationalized products include the ability to display and input different languages and character sets, support for different date and time formats, and compliance with regional regulations, such as privacy laws or product safety standards.

Internationalization is an important consideration for companies looking to expand their business into new markets or serve a global audience. It allows them to create products that are culturally sensitive, technically sound, and accessible to users in different regions of the world. By investing in internationalization, companies can increase their market share, build stronger relationships with customers, and gain a competitive advantage in the global marketplace.
