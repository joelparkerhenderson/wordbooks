# Design thinking

Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that emphasizes empathizing with the end-user, to understand problems, ideate potential solutions, and iterate until a solution is achieved.

The design thinking process typically involves five stages:

* Empathize: In this stage, designers seek to understand the needs, desires, and pain points of the end-user or customer. This can involve conducting research, interviews, and observation to gain insights into the user's perspective.

* Define: In this stage, designers define the problem they are trying to solve based on the insights gathered in the empathize stage. This involves reframing the problem in a way that focuses on the user's needs and interests.

* Ideate: In this stage, designers generate potential solutions to the problem identified in the define stage. This can involve brainstorming, sketching, and other creative techniques to generate a wide range of ideas.

* Prototype: In this stage, designers create tangible representations of their ideas in order to test and refine them. This can involve creating physical prototypes, digital mockups, or other types of prototypes that allow the designer to test the usability and effectiveness of the solution.

* Test: In this stage, designers test their prototypes with end-users or customers in order to gain feedback and insights into how well the solution meets their needs. Based on the feedback received, designers can refine and iterate their prototypes until a final solution is achieved.

Design thinking can be applied to a wide range of design problems, from product design to user experience design to organizational design. It is a flexible and iterative process that allows designers to stay focused on the user's needs and create innovative solutions that meet those needs.
