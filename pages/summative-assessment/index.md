# Summative assessment

Summative assessment is an evaluation method used to measure student learning and understanding at the end of a period of instruction. It is a type of formal assessment that is typically used to evaluate students' performance against a set of predetermined criteria, standards or learning objectives.

Summative assessments can take many forms, including final exams, projects, papers, standardized tests, and end-of-year assessments. The purpose of these assessments is to measure what students have learned over the course of the instructional period and provide an overall judgment of their mastery of the subject matter.

One of the key features of summative assessment is that it is usually graded or scored, providing students with feedback on their performance and helping to identify areas where they may need to improve. This type of assessment is typically used to determine final grades, promotion, or graduation eligibility.

While summative assessments are an important component of the educational process, they are not always able to provide the most complete picture of a student's learning. This is because they only provide a snapshot of a student's performance at a particular point in time, and do not take into account the learning process or growth that may have occurred during the instructional period.

Therefore, it is important for educators to use a combination of both formative and summative assessments to effectively evaluate student learning and provide a well-rounded assessment of their understanding.
