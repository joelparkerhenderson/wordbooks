# US H-1B visa

The United States H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa category that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. The visa program was created to address the shortage of skilled workers in certain fields and facilitate the hiring of foreign talent to contribute to the U.S. economy.

* Eligibility and Specialty Occupations: The H-1B visa is available to individuals who have a job offer from a U.S. employer in a specialty occupation, such as in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), finance, healthcare, or IT.

* Employer Sponsorship: The employer must submit a petition on behalf of the worker to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). If the petition is approved, the worker can apply for visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy abroad.

* Visa Cap and Lottery System: The H-1B visa program has an annual cap on the number of visas available, which is set by the U.S. Congress. Due to high demand, a lottery system is used.

* Duration of Stay: The initial period of stay on an H-1B visa is up to three years, and it can typically be extended for a maximum total period of six years. 

* Dependents: H-1B visa holders can bring their spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 to the U.S. as dependents. 

* Dual Intent: One notable feature of the H-1B visa is the concept of "dual intent." Unlike some other non-immigrant visas, H-1B visa holders are allowed to have the intention to immigrate permanently to the United States.

* Portability: H-1B visa holders have a degree of flexibility in changing employers. If they have an approved H-1B petition with one employer and receive a job offer from another employer, the new employer can file for a transfer.
