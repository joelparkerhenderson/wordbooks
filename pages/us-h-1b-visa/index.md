# US H-1B visa

The United States H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa category that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. The visa program was created to address the shortage of skilled workers in certain fields and facilitate the hiring of foreign talent to contribute to the U.S. economy. Here is a more detailed explanation of the H-1B visa program:

* Eligibility and Specialty Occupations: The H-1B visa is available to individuals who have a job offer from a U.S. employer in a specialty occupation. A specialty occupation is defined as a position that requires theoretical and practical application of highly specialized knowledge, usually requiring at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. The job must be in fields such as science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), finance, healthcare, IT, or other specialized fields.

* Employer Sponsorship: One of the key requirements of the H-1B visa is that the foreign worker must have an employer sponsor in the United States. The employer must submit a petition on behalf of the worker to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The employer must demonstrate the need for the foreign worker's specialized skills and comply with various labor conditions, including paying the prevailing wage for the occupation.

* Visa Cap and Lottery System: The H-1B visa program has an annual cap on the number of visas available, which is set by the U.S. Congress. Currently, the regular cap is set at 65,000 visas per fiscal year, with an additional 20,000 visas available for individuals who have obtained a master's degree or higher from a U.S. academic institution. Due to the high demand for H-1B visas, a lottery system is used when the number of applications exceeds the available cap.

* Application Process: To apply for an H-1B visa, the employer must file a Form I-129 petition with the USCIS. The petition includes various documents, such as the Labor Condition Application (LCA) certified by the U.S. Department of Labor, supporting evidence of the specialty occupation, the employer's financial information, and the beneficiary's qualifications. If the petition is approved, the worker can then apply for the H-1B visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy abroad.

* Duration of Stay: The initial period of stay on an H-1B visa is up to three years, and it can be extended for a maximum total period of six years. In some cases, H-1B holders may be eligible for extensions beyond the six-year limit if they have an approved employment-based immigrant petition (such as a green card application) but are subject to visa availability limitations.

* Dependents: H-1B visa holders can bring their spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 to the U.S. as dependents. Dependents are issued H-4 visas, which allow them to accompany the H-1B worker and may also be eligible for employment authorization under certain circumstances.

* Dual Intent: One notable feature of the H-1B visa is the concept of "dual intent." Unlike some other non-immigrant visas, H-1B visa holders are allowed to have the intention to immigrate permanently to the United States while maintaining temporary H-1B status. This means that H-1B workers can pursue lawful permanent residency (green card) without jeopardizing their non-immigrant status.

* Portability: H-1B visa holders have a degree of flexibility in changing employers while in the United States. If they have an approved H-1B petition with one employer and receive a job offer from another employer, they can begin working for the new employer once the new employer files.
