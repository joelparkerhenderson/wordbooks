# Business plan competition 

A business plan competition is an event or program that provides entrepreneurs and startup companies with the opportunity to present their business plans to a panel of judges, investors, and other industry professionals. The competition is designed to encourage the development of new and innovative businesses, as well as to provide support and funding opportunities for the most promising startups.

Business plan competitions can take many different forms, but they typically involve several key elements. First, entrepreneurs are invited to submit their business plans to the competition organizers. These plans are typically evaluated by a panel of judges who assess the viability and potential of each proposed business. The judges may consider factors such as the market opportunity, the strength of the management team, the potential for revenue growth, and the overall business strategy.

Once the initial screening process is complete, the most promising startups are invited to participate in the next phase of the competition. This may involve preparing and delivering a pitch presentation to the judges, which provides an opportunity for the entrepreneurs to showcase their business concept and convince the judges that their startup is worthy of investment.

In many cases, business plan competitions also offer support and resources to the participating startups. This may include access to mentorship, coaching, and training programs, as well as networking opportunities with investors and other industry professionals. Some competitions also offer cash prizes or other forms of funding to the winners, which can help to jumpstart their businesses and provide the resources needed to get off the ground.
