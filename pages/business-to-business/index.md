# Business-to-business (B2B)

Business-to-business (B2B) refers to a commercial transaction between two or more businesses. It involves the exchange of products, services, or information between businesses instead of between businesses and consumers.

B2B transactions are typically larger and more complex than B2C (business-to-consumer) transactions, as they often involve large quantities of products or services and require more negotiation and communication between parties. B2B transactions can involve both tangible goods and intangible services such as software or consulting services.

B2B transactions can take place between manufacturers and suppliers, wholesalers and retailers, or service providers and businesses that need those services. In many cases, B2B transactions are ongoing, forming long-term relationships between the businesses involved.

B2B marketing and sales often involve targeted marketing strategies, such as attending trade shows or targeting specific industries, as well as building relationships with key decision-makers within the businesses. The buying process in B2B transactions is typically more complex and involves multiple decision-makers, so it is important to build strong relationships and communicate effectively with all parties involved.
