# Business intelligence (BI)

Business intelligence (BI) refers to the processes, tools, and technologies that businesses use to collect, analyze, and present data for better decision-making. BI enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, rather than relying on intuition or guesswork. BI can reduce risk, optimize operations, and identify new opportunities for growth.

Examples of BI:

* Sales: Analyze sales data from different regions, products, or sales channels to identify trends and patterns. Adjust their sales strategies or focus on areas where they have the most potential for growth.

* Finance: Consolidate financial data from different sources, such as accounting software, bank statements, and invoices. Generate financial reports, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.

* Customers: Analyze customer data, such as demographics, purchase history, and behavior, to identify customer preferences, needs, and pain points. Develop more targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer service, and increase customer satisfaction.

* Supply chain management: Track inventory levels, monitor supplier performance, and optimize shipping and logistics. Reduce costs, minimize waste, and improve delivery times.

* Human resources: Track employee performance, analyze workforce demographics, and identify areas for improvement. Optimize staffing, improve training and development programs, and increase employee engagement.

BI tools come in many different forms, from simple dashboards and reports to more complex predictive analytics models. They may include AI/ML and automatic data analysis and identify insights more quickly.
