#  “Who” by Geoff Smart and Randy Street
 
"Who: The A Method for Hiring" is a book written by Geoff Smart and Randy Street, which provides a comprehensive guide for hiring top-performing individuals for an organization. The book outlines a methodology called the "A Method," which is a step-by-step approach to identify, evaluate, and hire top talent.

The "A Method" focuses on four key steps:

* Scorecard: The authors emphasize that the first step in hiring is to create a clear and concise job scorecard that outlines the responsibilities, outcomes, and competencies required for the role. This scorecard should be used as the foundation for all other steps in the hiring process.

* Source: Once the scorecard is created, the authors recommend identifying potential candidates through multiple channels, including referrals, job postings, and direct sourcing. They also suggest using a "50/25/25" rule for sourcing candidates, which means spending 50% of the time on referrals, 25% on job postings, and 25% on direct sourcing.

* Select: In this step, the authors recommend using a structured interview process that includes behavioral and situational questions to evaluate candidates against the scorecard. They also recommend conducting multiple interviews with different stakeholders, including team members, managers, and senior leaders.

* Sell: The final step in the process is to sell the job opportunity to the top candidate. The authors recommend using a "closing model" to overcome objections and ensure that the candidate is excited about the opportunity.
