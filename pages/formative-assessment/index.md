# Formative assessment

Formative assessment is an approach to learning and evaluation that involves ongoing feedback and evaluation throughout a learning process, rather than just at the end. The goal of formative assessment is to help students identify their strengths and weaknesses, set goals for improvement, and adjust their learning strategies to achieve better outcomes.

Unlike summative assessment, which is typically used to evaluate a student's performance at the end of a learning process, formative assessment is more continuous and provides ongoing feedback and support throughout the learning journey. This type of assessment is designed to help students improve their understanding of a subject, rather than simply measuring their knowledge.

Formative assessment can take many forms, including quizzes, tests, surveys, and observation. The key to effective formative assessment is to use a variety of different assessment tools to get a comprehensive understanding of a student's progress and to provide ongoing feedback that is tailored to their individual learning needs.

Some of the benefits of formative assessment include increased engagement and motivation, better understanding of the learning process, improved self-regulation skills, and increased confidence in learning. It can also help teachers identify areas where additional support or resources may be needed to help students succeed.
