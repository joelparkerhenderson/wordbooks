“Never Too Late to Startup” by Rob Kornblum is a comprehensive guide that aims to provide readers with the necessary tools and information to successfully start a business at any age. The book addresses the common fears and concerns of those who may feel that they have missed their opportunity to start a business, and encourages readers to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams regardless of their age or background.

The author draws on his own personal experience as a successful entrepreneur and investor, as well as his extensive research, to provide practical advice and insights for aspiring entrepreneurs.
