# Process Mapping 

Process Mapping is a technique used in business analysis to visually represent the flow of work or processes within an organization. It is a tool that helps to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and redundancies in processes, and to find ways to improve them.

The goal of process mapping is to provide a clear and detailed view of the current process and to identify opportunities for improvement. It is often used in conjunction with other business analysis tools and techniques such as workflow diagrams, swimlane diagrams, and value stream maps.

Typical steps:

* Identify the process to be mapped. This may involve conducting interviews with key stakeholders, reviewing documentation, or observing the process in action.

* Define the scope of the process. This involves defining the boundaries of the process, including the inputs, outputs, and stakeholders involved.

* Gather information. This involves reseraching the process steps that may be involved, the roles and responsibilities of those involved, and any relevant metrics or data.

* Create the process map. This involves creating a visual representation of the process, typically using a flowchart or similar diagram. The map includes the steps, decision points, and inputs and outputs at each step.

* Analyze the process. Use the map to dentify areas for improvement. This may involve looking for bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or redundancies, and identifying opportunities to streamline the process or eliminate unnecessary steps.

* Develop recommendations. Ideate how to improve the process based on the analysis. This may involve developing new procedures or workflows, or making changes to existing processes.

* Implement the recommendations. Do the recommended changes to the process, and monitor results to ensure that the changes have the desired effect.
