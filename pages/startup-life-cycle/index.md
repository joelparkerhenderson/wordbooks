# Startup life cycle

The startup life cycle is a a framework for understanding the stages of a startup's growth and development. The model identifies five key stages that startups typically go through:

1. Discovery: This stage is all about identifying a market opportunity and validating a business concept. Startups in this stage are focused on research, experimenting, and iterating on their ideas to find the best product-market fit. Founders are typically working on a shoestring budget, and the team is small.

2. Validation: In this stage, the startup has validated its business concept and has started to gain traction. The company has a few early adopters, and the team is working on expanding the customer base. The goal of this stage is to build a repeatable and scalable business model that can support growth.

3. Efficiency: The startup has achieved product-market fit, has a solid customer base, and is generating revenue. At this stage, the focus is on optimizing processes and improving efficiency. The company may be hiring more employees, and the team is focused on scaling the business.

4. Scale: At this stage, the startup has proven its ability to generate revenue and has a clear path to profitability. The focus is on scaling the business as quickly as possible. The company may be raising funds to fuel growth and is expanding into new markets.

5. Harvest: The final stage is all about maximizing the value of the startup. The company may be looking to sell to a larger company, go public, or take other steps to cash out on the value created.

This is a useful tool for founders and investors alike. By understanding the different stages of a startup's growth, founders can plan and execute their strategies more effectively. Investors can also use the model to evaluate startups and make better investment decisions.
