# Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)

A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is a legal agreement between a government agency or laboratory and one or more external organizations, including industry, academia, or other government agencies. The goal of a CRADA is to encourage collaboration between the government and external organizations in order to promote scientific and technological advancements that are in the public interest.

A CRADA can involve a wide range of collaborative activities, such as research and development, testing and evaluation, data exchange, and training. The terms of the agreement are typically negotiated between the government agency and the external party, and may include provisions related to intellectual property, confidentiality, liability, and funding.

One of the primary benefits of a CRADA is that it allows external organizations to gain access to government facilities, expertise, and resources that may not be available elsewhere. This can be particularly valuable for companies that are developing new technologies or products that require specialized equipment or knowledge.

Another benefit of a CRADA is that it can provide a streamlined mechanism for transferring technology developed by the government to the private sector. This can be especially important for technologies that have potential commercial applications, but may not have been fully developed or tested.

A CRADA can be an effective way for government agencies and external organizations to work together to advance scientific and technological knowledge and to promote economic growth and development. However, it is important to carefully review and negotiate the terms of the agreement to ensure that the interests of all parties are adequately protected.
