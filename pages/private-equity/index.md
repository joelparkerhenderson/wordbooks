# Private equity (PE)

Private equity (PE) is a type of investment in which investors pool together their money and acquire ownership stakes in private companies or participate in buyouts of public companies to take them private. The goal of private equity investors is to invest in businesses that have potential for growth or require restructuring to improve operations, increase profitability, and enhance shareholder value.

PE investments are typically made in mature businesses that require a significant amount of capital to achieve their growth potential, as well as in turnaround situations, where investors can take control of the company and implement operational and financial changes to improve its performance.

Private equity investors typically have a long-term investment horizon, often holding onto their investments for five to seven years or more. They may also invest in several rounds over the course of the investment period, providing additional capital to support growth initiatives or other strategic initiatives.

The primary source of returns for private equity investors is through the sale of their ownership stake in the company, often through a public offering or a sale to another company.

Private equity investors may have different investment strategies, such as venture capital, growth equity, or buyout funds. Venture capital funds typically invest in early-stage companies with a high potential for growth, while growth equity funds invest in more mature companies that are already profitable and have established market positions. Buyout funds typically invest in mature companies that require operational and financial improvements, with the goal of selling the company for a profit after a period of time.
