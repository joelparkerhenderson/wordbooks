Private equity (PE) is a type of investment in which investors pool together their money and acquire ownership stakes in private companies or participate in buyouts of public companies to take them private. The goal of private equity investors is to invest in businesses that have potential for growth or require restructuring to improve operations, increase profitability, and enhance shareholder value.

Private equity investors typically invest in companies with strong potential for growth or a promising market position, but which may be undervalued or underperforming. These investments are typically made in mature businesses that require a significant amount of capital to achieve their growth potential. Private equity investors may also invest in distressed or turnaround situations, where they can take control of the company and implement operational and financial changes to improve its performance.

Private equity investors typically have a long-term investment horizon, often holding onto their investments for five to seven years or more. They may also invest in several rounds over the course of the investment period, providing additional capital to support growth initiatives or other strategic initiatives.

The primary source of returns for private equity investors is through the sale of their ownership stake in the company, often through a public offering or a sale to another company. Private equity investors may also earn returns through dividend payments or other distributions from the company.

Private equity investors may have different investment strategies, such as venture capital, growth equity, or buyout funds. Venture capital funds typically invest in early-stage companies with a high potential for growth, while growth equity funds invest in more mature companies that are already profitable and have established market positions. Buyout funds typically invest in mature companies that require operational and financial improvements, with the goal of selling the company for a profit after a period of time.

Private equity investors typically require a higher return on their investments compared to other types of investors, such as banks or public equity investors. This is due to the higher risk associated with private equity investments, as well as the illiquid nature of these investments. Private equity investors often have specific investment criteria and may conduct extensive due diligence before making an investment.
