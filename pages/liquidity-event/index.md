# Liquidity event

A liquidity event is a financial event that provides the opportunity for investors, employees, and other stakeholders in a company to sell their ownership or equity interest in the company for cash or other forms of liquid assets. In simpler terms, it is an event that allows individuals to turn their ownership stake in a company into cash.

There are several types of liquidity events that can occur in a company. One common example is an initial public offering (IPO), which is when a company sells its shares to the public for the first time, allowing shareholders to sell their shares on a public stock exchange. Another example is a merger or acquisition, where a company is bought by another company or merges with another company, providing liquidity for the original company's shareholders.

Other examples of liquidity events include secondary offerings, where additional shares of a public company are offered to the public; share repurchases, where a company buys back its own shares from shareholders; and dividend payouts, where a company distributes profits to its shareholders.

For startup companies, a liquidity event can be a major goal, as it allows early investors and employees to cash out on their investments and equity stakes in the company. In addition, a liquidity event can provide the company with additional capital to grow and expand its operations. However, it is important to note that not all companies will have a liquidity event, and some may choose to remain private or independent.
