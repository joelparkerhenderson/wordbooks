# Skip-level meeting

A skip-level meeting is a type of meeting in which a manager or executive meets with employees who are not their direct reports, but rather employees from the next level down. In other words, the manager or executive skips a level in the hierarchy to meet with employees who work directly under their subordinates.

The purpose of a skip-level meeting is to create an open and transparent communication channel between higher-level management and front-line employees. This type of meeting can help to build trust, increase employee engagement and job satisfaction, and promote a sense of community within the organization. Skip-level meetings can also provide managers with valuable insights into the challenges faced by front-line employees, as well as ideas for improving processes and procedures.

Here are some key aspects of skip-level meetings:

* Preparation: Managers should prepare for skip-level meetings by reviewing the work of the employees they will be meeting with, including their job descriptions, performance reviews, and any relevant metrics. They should also have a clear agenda for the meeting, with specific topics they want to discuss.

* Timing: Skip-level meetings should be scheduled at a time that is convenient for employees and that allows for a meaningful discussion. They should not be too frequent, as this can be disruptive to work, but they should also not be too infrequent, as this can lead to a lack of communication and understanding.

* Focus on listening: The purpose of a skip-level meeting is to listen to front-line employees and gather feedback. Managers should avoid dominating the conversation and instead focus on listening to the concerns and ideas of their employees.

* Action: Managers should follow up on any concerns or ideas raised during skip-level meetings. They should also communicate any changes or updates to the employees they met with, to demonstrate that their feedback was taken seriously.

Skip-level meetings can be an effective way to improve communication and build relationships within an organization. By providing a forum for front-line employees to share their concerns and ideas with higher-level management, skip-level meetings can help to create a more engaged and productive workforce.
