# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an entity, such as a user or a device, before allowing access to a system or service. In computing, authentication is typically performed using a combination of something the entity knows (such as a password or PIN), something the entity has (such as a smart card or token), or something the entity is (such as a biometric feature like a fingerprint or iris scan).

The purpose of authentication is to prevent unauthorized access to systems, data, or services by verifying that the entity requesting access is who they claim to be. It is an essential component of information security and is used in many different contexts, including logging into a computer or network, accessing an online service or application, or conducting a financial transaction.

There are several types of authentication methods, including:

* Password-based authentication: This is the most common form of authentication, in which a user enters a username and password to access a system or service. However, this method is vulnerable to attacks like password guessing or phishing.

* Multi-factor authentication (MFA): This method requires the user to provide two or more forms of identification before granting access. For example, a user might enter a password and then receive a one-time code via text message or mobile app.

* Biometric authentication: This method uses a physical characteristic of the user, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition, to verify their identity.

* Certificate-based authentication: This method uses digital certificates to authenticate users, devices, or applications.

* Token-based authentication: This method uses a physical token, such as a smart card or USB drive, to authenticate users.

Authentication is often used in conjunction with authorization, which is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the authenticated user's privileges or permissions. Together, authentication and authorization are critical components of access control in information security.
