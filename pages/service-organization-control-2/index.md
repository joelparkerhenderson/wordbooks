# Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2)

Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) is a set of auditing standards developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) for assessing the effectiveness of a service organization's information security and privacy policies, procedures, and controls. SOC 2 audits are conducted by independent auditors to provide assurance to  stakeholders that the organization is protecting sensitive information.

The SOC 2 framework is based on the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) developed by the AICPA, which include the following five categories:

* Security: The service organization's system is protected against unauthorized access, both physical and logical.

* Availability: The service organization's system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed to.

* Processing integrity: System processing is complete, accurate, timely, and authorized.

* Confidentiality: Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed to.

* Privacy: Personal information is collected, used, retained, and disclosed in conformity with the commitments in the entity's privacy notice.

SOC 2 reports can be of two types: Type I and Type II. A Type I report assesses the design of the controls at a point in time, while a Type II report assesses both the design and operating effectiveness of the controls over a period of time (usually 6-12 months).

To get a SOC 2 report, an organization engages an independent auditor to examine the controls. The auditor provides opinions on whether the controls are suitably designed and operating effectively to meet TSC criteria. The auditor's report provides assurances that the controls are appropriate.
