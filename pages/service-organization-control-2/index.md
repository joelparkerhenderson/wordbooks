# Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2)

Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) is a set of auditing standards developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) for assessing the effectiveness of a service organization's information security and privacy policies, procedures, and controls. SOC 2 audits are conducted by independent auditors to provide assurance to customers and other stakeholders that the organization has adequate controls in place to protect sensitive information.

The SOC 2 framework is based on the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) developed by the AICPA, which include the following five categories:

* Security: The service organization's system is protected against unauthorized access, both physical and logical.

* Availability: The service organization's system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed to.

* Processing integrity: System processing is complete, accurate, timely, and authorized.

* Confidentiality: Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed to.

* Privacy: Personal information is collected, used, retained, and disclosed in conformity with the commitments in the entity's privacy notice.

To obtain a SOC 2 report, a service organization must engage an independent auditor to perform an examination of its controls over a period of time. The auditor provides an opinion on whether the controls are suitably designed and operating effectively to meet the TSC criteria. The resulting SOC 2 report provides customers and other stakeholders with assurance that the organization has implemented appropriate controls to protect sensitive information.

SOC 2 reports can be of two types - Type I and Type II. A Type I report assesses the design of the controls at a point in time, while a Type II report assesses both the design and operating effectiveness of the controls over a period of time (usually 6-12 months).
