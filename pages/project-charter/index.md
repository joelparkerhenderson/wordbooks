# Project charter

A project charter is a formal document that outlines the purpose, scope, objectives, and stakeholders of a project. It is a foundational document that provides a framework for project planning, execution, and monitoring. The project charter is created during the early stages of the project, usually during the initiation phase, and is approved by the project sponsor and other key stakeholders.

The project charter includes several key components, which are as follows:

* Project Purpose: The project purpose outlines the reason for initiating the project, its benefits and how it aligns with the organization's strategic goals.

* Project Scope: The project scope outlines the boundaries of the project and what is included and excluded.

* Objectives: The objectives define the desired outcomes of the project in specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound terms.

* Deliverables: The deliverables are the tangible products or services that the project will produce.

* Stakeholders: The stakeholders are the individuals, groups or organizations that are impacted by or can impact the project.

* Assumptions: The assumptions are the factors that are taken for granted and not validated.

* Risks: The risks are the potential events or circumstances that could negatively impact the project.

* Budget: The budget is the estimated cost of the project.

* Schedule: The schedule is the timeline for completing the project.

The project charter serves as a guiding document for the project team and stakeholders. The project charter is a living document that may be updated as the project progresses and new information becomes available.
