# Drag-along rights

Drag-along rights are a legal provision that gives a majority shareholder or group of shareholders the right to force minority shareholders to join in the sale of a company. In other words, if a majority of shareholders agree to sell the company to a third party, they can "drag along" the minority shareholders, who would otherwise be able to block the sale.

Drag-along rights are typically included in a company's shareholder agreement or articles of incorporation, and they are intended to provide a mechanism for ensuring that a potential sale or merger is not derailed by a small minority of shareholders who are not interested in selling their shares.

For example, let's say that a company has three shareholders: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice and Bob together own 75% of the company, while Charlie owns 25%. If Alice and Bob decide to sell the company to a third party, they could invoke their drag-along rights to force Charlie to sell his shares as well. Without drag-along rights, Charlie could block the sale by refusing to sell his shares.

Drag-along rights are often negotiated between venture capitalists and startup founders when a startup receives funding. VCs typically want to ensure that they have the ability to sell their shares and exit the investment if the opportunity arises, and drag-along rights help to facilitate that process. However, it's important for founders to carefully consider the terms of any drag-along provision to ensure that they are not giving up too much control over the fate of their company.
