# Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a United States federal law that was enacted in 1974. It applies to educational institutions that receive federal funding, including elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities. The purpose is to protect the privacy of students' education records and to give them certain rights with respect to those records.

Under FERPA, educational institutions are required to:

* Obtain written consent from students or their parents before disclosing any personally identifiable information from education records, with certain exceptions.

* Allow students or their parents to inspect and review their education records within 45 days of the request.

* Correct any inaccurate or misleading information in their education records.

* Limit access to education records to only those who have a legitimate educational interest in them.

FERPA defines education records as any records that are directly related to a student and maintained by an educational institution or its representatives. Examples: grades, transcripts, records, and financial information.

FERPA provides exceptions to the consent requirement. For example, educational institutions may disclose education records without consent to some officials and authorities, if they have a legitimate interest.

FERPA violations can result in the loss of federal funding for an educational institution, as well as reputational damage and legal liability.
