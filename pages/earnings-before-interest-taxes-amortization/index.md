# Earnings before interest, taxes, amortization (EBITA)

Earnings before interest, taxes, amortization (EBITA) is a financial metric used to measure a company's operating profitability without including the effects of financing and accounting decisions. It is similar to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), but it adds the amortization expense to the calculation.

EBITA is calculated by subtracting a company's operating expenses, excluding interest, taxes, and amortization, from its revenue. The resulting figure represents the company's operating earnings before taking into account financing and accounting decisions.

The amortization expense that is added to EBITA represents the gradual reduction in value of intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, and goodwill. By including this expense in the calculation, EBITA provides a more accurate representation of a company's financial health.

EBITA is often used by investors and analysts as a measure of a company's operational efficiency and profitability. It allows them to compare the performance of different companies, regardless of their capital structure or accounting methods.

EBITA can also be used to evaluate the financial impact of business decisions, such as mergers and acquisitions or changes in operational strategy. By calculating the EBITA of the combined entity before and after the transaction, investors can assess whether the deal is likely to be accretive or dilutive to earnings.

However, it is important to note that EBITA has limitations as a financial metric. It does not take into account the effects of depreciation, changes in working capital, or capital expenditures, which can significantly impact a company's financial performance. Additionally, EBITA may be less useful for companies with high levels of debt or those operating in capital-intensive industries.
