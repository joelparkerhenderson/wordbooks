# Limited Liability Company (LLC)

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a type of business entity that is designed to provide limited liability protection to its owners, while also offering the benefits of a partnership or sole proprietorship. In an LLC, the owners are known as "members" and they have limited liability protection, which means that their personal assets are not at risk in case the company is sued or incurs debts.

Limited liability protection is a key feature of LLCs. It means that if the company faces legal issues, such as lawsuits or bankruptcy, the personal assets of the members, such as their homes or cars, are not at risk. Only the assets of the LLC itself are at risk. This is different from sole proprietorships and partnerships, where the personal assets of the owners are at risk in case of legal issues.

An LLC also provides a flexible management structure. Members can choose to manage the LLC themselves, or they can appoint a manager to run the company on their behalf. This allows the members to focus on their own areas of expertise, while still having control over the company's operations.

Another advantage of LLCs is that they offer pass-through taxation. This means that the profits and losses of the LLC are passed through to the members, who report them on their individual tax returns. The LLC itself does not pay federal income taxes, but it may be required to pay state taxes.

Setting up an LLC is relatively easy and inexpensive compared to other business structures, such as corporations. To form an LLC, the members must file articles of organization with the state and pay the required fees. They must also draft an operating agreement, which outlines the rules and procedures for managing the LLC.

An LLC is a popular choice for small businesses and entrepreneurs because it provides the benefits of limited liability protection, flexible management, and pass-through taxation. However, it's important to consult with a qualified attorney or accountant to determine if an LLC is the best option for your specific business needs and circumstances.
