# Elevator pitch

An elevator pitch is a short, persuasive speech that is typically used to quickly and effectively communicate an idea or business proposal. It is called an "elevator pitch" because the idea is that it should be able to be delivered in the amount of time it takes to ride an elevator, usually around 30 seconds to two minutes.

The goal of an elevator pitch is to make a strong impression on the listener and generate interest in the idea or proposal being presented. It should be concise, compelling, and tailored to the audience. The pitch should clearly and succinctly explain what the idea or business does, who it serves, and why it is unique or valuable.

A well-crafted elevator pitch should answer the following questions:

* What problem does your idea solve?

* How does your idea solve that problem?

* Who is your target audience?

* What makes your idea unique or different from other solutions?

* What is your call to action?

An elevator pitch can be used in a variety of settings, such as networking events, job interviews, or when seeking funding for a startup. It should be rehearsed and refined over time to ensure that it is effective and can be delivered with confidence.
