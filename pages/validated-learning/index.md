# Validated learning

Validated learning is a concept in the Lean Startup methodology that emphasizes the importance of testing assumptions and hypotheses early and often to validate or invalidate them with empirical evidence. The goal of validated learning is to reduce the risk and uncertainty associated with creating and launching a new product or service, and to enable startups to make more informed decisions based on actual customer feedback rather than relying on assumptions or guesswork.

The process of validated learning typically involves creating a minimum viable product (MVP) that incorporates the core features and value proposition of the product or service, and then testing it with a small group of early adopters or beta users. The feedback and data generated by these initial tests are then used to refine the product or service, iterate on the design, and identify potential flaws or areas for improvement.

The key to successful validated learning is to design experiments that are structured to test specific hypotheses or assumptions, and to gather data in a systematic and objective way. This may involve using surveys, user testing, A/B testing, or other methods to collect and analyze feedback and performance data from users.

By focusing on validated learning, startups can reduce the risk of failure and avoid investing time and resources in products or services that may not be viable or valuable to customers. Instead, they can use data-driven insights to refine and improve their offerings, and to make more informed decisions about how to grow and scale their business over time.
