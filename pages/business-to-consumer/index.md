# Business-to-consumer (B2C)

Business-to-consumer (B2C) refers to a type of commerce transaction where a business sells goods or services directly to consumers who are the end-users of those goods or services. This means that the products or services are aimed at individual customers who will use or consume them.

In B2C transactions, the focus is on the individual consumer, and the business must create a strong brand image and reputation to attract and retain customers. Marketing and advertising efforts are geared towards creating awareness and demand among consumers, and the business must strive to provide a satisfying customer experience, including convenient payment methods, easy returns, and customer support.

Examples of B2C businesses include retailers, restaurants, online marketplaces, and service providers such as gyms or hair salons. In recent years, the growth of e-commerce has allowed businesses to sell directly to consumers through online marketplaces, social media platforms, and mobile apps, which has made it easier for small businesses to reach a larger audience.

B2C transactions are typically characterized by smaller purchase amounts and higher transaction volumes, as individual consumers tend to purchase smaller quantities of goods or services more frequently than businesses. B2C businesses must also comply with consumer protection laws and regulations, such as those related to data privacy, product safety, and advertising practices, which are designed to protect the interests of individual consumers.
