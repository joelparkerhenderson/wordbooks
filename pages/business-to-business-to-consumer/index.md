# Business-to-Business-to-Consumer (B2B2C)

Business-to-Business-to-Consumer (B2B2C) is a business model that involves a company selling its products or services to other businesses, which in turn sell the same products or services to consumers. 

The B2B2C model is often used in industries where businesses work together to provide a comprehensive solution to consumers. For example, a company that produces a software application might partner with a hardware manufacturer to bundle their software with the manufacturer's hardware, and then sell the bundled product to consumers. In this case, the software company sells to the hardware manufacturer (B2B), and the hardware manufacturer sells to the end customer (B2C).

Another example is when an e-commerce company sells products through its website, but also allows other businesses to sell their products on the same platform. The e-commerce company provides the platform and infrastructure for the other businesses to sell their products, while the other businesses provide the products themselves. This allows the e-commerce company to offer a wider selection of products to consumers, while the other businesses benefit from the increased exposure and potential sales.

B2B2C can offer advantages to all parties involved. For businesses that sell their products or services through another company, B2B2C can provide access to a larger customer base than they might have been able to reach on their own. For the company that provides the platform or infrastructure for other businesses to sell their products or services, B2B2C can provide a new revenue stream and a way to expand their offerings without having to create new products or services themselves. Finally, for consumers, B2B2C can provide access to a wider variety of products and services, often at lower prices than they would find from individual companies.
