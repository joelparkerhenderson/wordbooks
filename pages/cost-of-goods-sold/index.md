# Cost of goods sold (COGS)

Cost of goods sold (COGS) is a key component of a company's financial statements, specifically the income statement. It represents the direct costs associated with producing or acquiring the goods that a company sells, including materials, labor, and overhead expenses.

COGS is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods that have not been sold from the total cost of goods available for sale during a specific period of time. The cost of goods that have not been sold includes inventory that remains unsold at the end of the period, which is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset.

The cost of goods sold formula can be expressed as follows:

COGS = Beginning inventory + Purchases during the period - Ending inventory

To better understand the concept of COGS, consider a simple example. Let's say a company produces and sells t-shirts. The cost of producing each t-shirt includes the cost of the fabric, the cost of labor to cut and sew the fabric, and the cost of shipping the finished product to the warehouse. These direct costs would be included in the COGS.

On the other hand, indirect costs such as rent for the factory, electricity, and salaries of employees not directly involved in production are not included in COGS. These costs are instead considered overhead expenses and are included in the company's operating expenses.

COGS is an important metric for companies because it directly impacts the company's profitability. If the COGS is too high, the company may not be able to sell its products at a competitive price, and its profit margins may suffer. On the other hand, if the COGS is too low, the company may be cutting corners on quality, which could lead to reduced customer satisfaction and ultimately hurt the company's reputation and bottom line.
