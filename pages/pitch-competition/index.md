# Pitch competition

A pitch competition is an event where entrepreneurs and startups pitch their business ideas or products to a panel of judges, investors, and sometimes a live audience, with the goal of securing funding or other forms of support for their venture. These competitions are often hosted by universities, accelerator programs, or venture capital firms, and they provide startups with the opportunity to showcase their ideas, receive feedback from experienced professionals, and potentially win funding or other resources.

In a typical pitch competition, startups are given a set amount of time, usually 3-10 minutes, to present their idea or product to a panel of judges. The presentation may include a slide deck, a product demo, and other visual aids to help convey the key aspects of the venture. After the presentation, the judges will often ask questions or provide feedback on the pitch and the startup's overall business plan.

The judging criteria for a pitch competition can vary, but often includes factors such as the uniqueness and innovation of the idea, the potential market size and opportunity, the strength and experience of the team, and the overall viability and scalability of the venture.

Many pitch competitions offer prizes or funding to the winners, which can range from small amounts of cash to significant investments from venture capital firms or angel investors. In addition to funding, winning a pitch competition can also provide valuable exposure and networking opportunities for startups, which can help them to gain traction and grow their business.
