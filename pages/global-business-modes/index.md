# Global business modes

Companies engage in global business through various modes, depending on their objectives, resources, and the level of control they seek. These modes include:

* Importing and Exporting: The most basic form of global business involves the importation and exportation of goods and services across national borders. Companies engage in international trade to access foreign markets, source inputs, or take advantage of cost differentials.

* Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): FDI occurs when a company invests in establishing or acquiring business operations in another country. This can take the form of setting up manufacturing plants, opening branches or subsidiaries, or acquiring existing businesses. FDI allows companies to have more direct control over their foreign operations and access local markets and resources.

* Licensing and Franchising: Licensing involves granting permission to another party in a different country to use a company's intellectual property, technology, or brand in exchange for royalties or licensing fees. Franchising is a similar concept, where a company grants the right to operate under its established business model and brand in another location.

* Contract Manufacturing and Outsourcing: Companies may outsource manufacturing or certain business functions to third-party suppliers or service providers located in other countries. This allows businesses to benefit from cost advantages, specialized expertise, or flexibility in their operations.
