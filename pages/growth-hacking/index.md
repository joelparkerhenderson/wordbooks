# Growth hacking 

Growth hacking refers to a set of marketing strategies and tactics aimed at achieving rapid and sustained growth for a company or product. It involves using data-driven experimentation, creativity, and unconventional methods to rapidly test and iterate on different marketing approaches.

The key tenets of growth hacking include:

* A focus on metrics: Growth hackers are obsessed with data, and use metrics such as user acquisition, activation, retention, and referral to guide their efforts.

* Rapid experimentation: Growth hackers use a process of rapid experimentation, testing out new ideas and measuring their impact to determine what works and what doesn't.

* A creative mindset: Growth hacking often involves thinking outside the box and coming up with unconventional approaches to marketing.

* Leveraging existing platforms: Growth hackers often use existing platforms such as social media, search engines, and email marketing to reach their target audience.

* A cross-functional approach: Growth hacking requires collaboration between different teams, including marketing, product, engineering, and data analysis.

Some examples of growth hacking tactics include:

* A/B testing: Testing different versions of marketing campaigns or product features to see which one performs better.

* Viral marketing: Encouraging existing users to share the product with their friends, family, and colleagues.

* Content marketing: Creating valuable content that attracts and retains users, such as blog posts, infographics, or videos.

* Search engine optimization (SEO): Optimizing the product's website to rank higher in search engine results.

* Referral programs: Encouraging users to refer their friends in exchange for a discount or other incentive.
