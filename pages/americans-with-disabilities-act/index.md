# Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that was passed in 1990 to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in areas such as employment, public accommodations, transportation, telecommunications, and government services.

The ADA defines a disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, such as walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, or learning. The definition also includes individuals who have a history of such an impairment, or who are perceived as having such an impairment.

Under the ADA, employers with 15 or more employees are required to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities, as long as the accommodations do not create an undue hardship for the employer. Reasonable accommodations may include changes to job duties, work schedules, or physical work environments, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, such as sign language interpreters or assistive technology.

Public accommodations, such as restaurants, hotels, and stores, are also required to provide equal access to individuals with disabilities. This may include providing accessible entrances, parking spaces, and restrooms, or providing auxiliary aids and services, such as braille menus or wheelchair ramps.

In addition, the ADA requires telecommunications companies to provide relay services for individuals with hearing or speech impairments, and requires state and local governments to provide equal access to government services and programs.

The ADA has had a significant impact in improving the lives of individuals with disabilities and increasing their participation in society. However, challenges and barriers still exist, and ongoing efforts are needed to ensure full compliance with the law and to promote greater inclusion and accessibility for individuals with disabilities.
