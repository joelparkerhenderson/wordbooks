# Technology transfer 

Technology transfer for startups refers to the process of transferring technology, knowledge, or intellectual property from research institutions, universities, or established companies to startup ventures for commercialization.

Technology transfer can originate from various sources, including research institutions, universities, laboratories, and established companies. Transfer can happen through partnerships, collaborations, or the spinoff of specific business units.

Licensing agreements play a central role in technology transfer. These agreements outline the terms and conditions under which the startup can use the intellectual property. Licensing agreements may include provisions related to royalties, exclusivity, territorial restrictions, sublicensing, and the duration of the license.

Collaborative partnerships can provide startups with access to research facilities, equipment, technical expertise, and mentorship. At the same time, the originator benefits from the agility and entrepreneurial spirit of the startup.

Commercialization begins when the startup assumes the responsibility for refining, validating, and scaling the technology for commercial applications. This involves market analysis, customer discovery, and product development.

Funding and support can come from various sources, including venture capital firms, angel investors, government grants, or industry-specific funding programs. Additionally, startups may receive mentorship, or work with the established company's preferred incubator or accelerator.
