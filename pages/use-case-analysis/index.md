# Use case analysis

Use case analysis is a technique used in software engineering, systems engineering, and product management to understand the requirements and behavior of a system or product. It is a process of identifying the user's requirements and the steps needed to achieve them. A use case is a sequence of actions that are performed by a user to achieve a specific goal. Use case analysis is a key part of the software development life cycle and is used to ensure that the software or product meets the requirements of the end-users.

The use case analysis process involves several steps:

* Identifying Actors: Actors are the individuals or systems that interact with the system or product being analyzed. They may include end-users, administrators, or other systems.

* Defining Use Cases: Use cases are the sequences of steps that the actors perform to achieve their goals. Each use case should be a discrete, measurable action that can be tested.

* Describing Use Cases: Use cases are described in detail, including the inputs, outputs, and interactions between the actors and the system.

* Prioritizing Use Cases: Use cases are prioritized based on their importance to the end-users and the system's functionality.

* Validating Use Cases: Use cases are validated by testing them against real-world scenarios and verifying that they achieve their intended goals.

Use case analysis helps to identify the key features and requirements of a system or product and ensures that the development team focuses on delivering the most important features to the end-users. It also helps to identify potential issues or problems with the system or product before it is released to the public.
