# Federation

In the context of software, federation refers to a system design pattern that allows different systems or organizations to work together as if they were part of a single, unified system. In a federation, each system maintains control over its own resources and data, but can share that information with other systems in a controlled and standardized way.

Federated systems are often used in large, complex organizations or in situations where multiple parties need to work together to achieve a common goal. Examples of federated systems include:

* Federated identity management systems: These systems allow different organizations to share user authentication and authorization information, enabling users to access multiple systems with a single set of credentials.

* Federated search systems: These systems allow users to search across multiple sources of information, such as databases, websites, and other online resources.

* Federated data warehouses: These systems allow organizations to combine data from multiple sources into a single, unified database, while maintaining control over their own data.

Federation requires a set of standards and protocols that enable different systems to communicate with each other in a standardized way. Some examples of these standards and protocols include:

* Service-oriented architecture (SOA): This is an architectural style that emphasizes the use of services as the fundamental building blocks of a software system. Services are self-contained, modular components that can be easily combined to create larger, more complex systems.

* Representational State Transfer (REST): This is a set of principles for building web services that use standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to access and manipulate resources.

* Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP): This is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services.

Federated systems offer several advantages over centralized systems. For example:

* Scalability: Federated systems can scale more easily than centralized systems, as each system can be scaled independently.

* Flexibility: Federated systems are more flexible than centralized systems, as they allow different organizations to use their own systems and technologies.

* Security: Federated systems can be more secure than centralized systems, as each system can maintain control over its own data and resources.

However, federated systems also have some drawbacks, such as increased complexity and the need for careful management of data and resources across multiple systems.
