# Term sheet

A term sheet is a document that outlines the terms and conditions of a potential investment deal between an investor and a company seeking funding. It is a non-binding agreement that serves as a basis for negotiations, and once agreed upon, forms the basis for a more detailed and legally binding investment agreement. The term sheet is typically prepared by the investor and outlines the basic terms of the investment, including the amount of funding, the valuation of the company, and the rights and preferences of the investor.

The key components of a term sheet may include:

* Valuation: The valuation of the company is one of the most important aspects of the term sheet, as it determines the percentage of the company that the investor will own in exchange for their investment.

* Investment amount: The amount of funding being provided by the investor, and the structure of the investment (e.g. equity, debt, convertible note, etc.).

* Terms of the investment: This includes details about the structure of the investment, such as the type of security being issued, any dividends or interest payments, and the length of the investment.

* Board composition: The term sheet may specify the number of seats on the board of directors that the investor will be entitled to, and any other governance rights they may have.

* Rights and preferences: The term sheet may also outline the investor's rights and preferences, such as anti-dilution protection, participation rights, and liquidation preferences.

* Information rights: The term sheet may specify what information the investor is entitled to receive about the company, and how often they will receive it.
