# Earned income

Earned income is income that is earned through employment or self-employment activities. This includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and tips, as well as income from freelance or contract work. Earned income is distinguished from other forms of income, such as investment income or passive income, which are earned through owning assets or investments.

Earned income is subject to taxation by the government, and taxes are typically withheld from an employee's paycheck. Self-employed individuals are responsible for calculating and paying their own taxes, and may be subject to additional taxes, such as self-employment tax.

Earned income is an important source of income for most people, as it provides the means to cover living expenses, save for retirement, and invest in the future. However, earned income is not always a stable source of income, as it can be affected by factors such as job loss, wage stagnation, or changes in the economy.

There are many factors that can affect earned income, including education, experience, skills, and the labor market. Individuals with higher levels of education and more experience in their field typically earn higher wages than those with less education or experience. In addition, certain industries or geographic regions may offer higher wages than others, based on supply and demand factors.

There are also various strategies that individuals can use to increase their earned income, such as acquiring new skills or certifications, seeking promotions or career advancement, or pursuing higher-paying job opportunities. Self-employment can also provide opportunities to earn higher income, although it also carries additional risks and responsibilities.
