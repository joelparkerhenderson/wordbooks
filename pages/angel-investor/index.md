# Angel investor

An angel investor is an individual who provides moeny to early-stage startups, typically in exchange for an equity stake in the company. Angel investors are typically wealthy individuals who enjoy investing in startups.

Angel investors can provide several benefits to startups beyond just funding. They may have expertise in a particular industry, and can provide mentorship and advice to the startup. They may also have a network of contacts, including other investors and potential customers, that can help the startup grow.

Angel investors typically invest smaller amounts than venture capitalists, with investments typically ranging from tens of thousands to a few million dollars. They may invest in multiple startups, diversifying their portfolio and reducing their overall risk.

The process of finding angel investors typically involves networking and building relationships with potential investors. This may involve attending industry events, reaching out to investor groups or online platforms, or seeking introductions through professional networks.

In exchange for their investment, angel investors typically receive an equity stake in the company, and may also receive additional rights and privileges, such as a seat on the board of directors or the ability to veto certain decisions.

Angel investing is often considered a high-risk, high-reward activity, as not all startups will achieve the level of success needed to provide significant returns to investors. As such, angel investors should be prepared to invest in a portfolio of startups, diversifying their investments to reduce their overall risk.

Overall, angel investors can provide a valuable source of funding and support to early-stage startups, helping them to grow and achieve their potential. For entrepreneurs seeking funding, angel investors can be a valuable source of capital, mentorship, and expertise.
