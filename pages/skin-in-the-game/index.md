# Skin in the game

"Skin in the game" is a phrase that refers to the concept of having a personal stake or investment in the outcome of a particular decision or venture. It suggests that individuals or organizations are more likely to act in the best interest of the project or enterprise if they have something to lose if it fails.

The phrase was popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a renowned statistician and author, who argued that many people in positions of power or authority, such as politicians or corporate executives, often make decisions that have little to no personal consequences, while leaving others to bear the risks or costs of those decisions.

The idea of "skin in the game" is often applied in business and finance, where investors, executives, and employees are encouraged to have a personal financial stake in the success of the company. This can take the form of stock options, performance-based bonuses, or other incentives tied to the company's performance.

Having "skin in the game" is also important in entrepreneurship, where founders often invest their own money and time in their startups, rather than relying solely on outside investors or funding sources. This can help to align the interests of the founder with those of the company and its stakeholders, and ensure that the founder is motivated to work hard and make sound decisions.

In addition to business and finance, "skin in the game" can also be applied to other areas of life, such as politics and social justice. For example, politicians who are personally affected by the policies they enact, such as healthcare or tax reform, may be more motivated to make decisions that benefit their constituents, rather than their own interests or those of their donors.
