# Work-for-hire agreement

A work-for-hire agreement is a type of legal contract that outlines the terms of a creative work or project that is commissioned by one party to be completed by another party, typically a freelancer or independent contractor. The agreement specifies that the work produced is owned by the hiring party, rather than the individual or company who created it. The agreement is often used when a company needs a specific project completed.

Typical aspects:

* Identification: Provide the parties' names, contact information, and any other relevant details.

* Scope: Explain what the worker is being hired to complete, including any specifications or requirements.

* Compensation: Describe the payment terms, including the amount, schedule, and other details.

* Ownership of intellectual property: who will own the rights to the work produced, including any patents, copyrights, trademarks, and the like.

* Confidentiality: Protect any proprietary information that may be shared during the course of the project.

* Termination: the circumstances under which the agreement may be terminated by either party, and any other relevant details related to termination.

* Governing law: specifics about the governing law that will be used in the event of any disputes or legal issues related to the agreement.

A work-for-hire agreement can help protect the interests of both parties involved in a creative project or work. It is recommended that all parties involved in a work-for-hire agreement seek legal advice to ensure that the terms of the agreement are fair and legally binding.
