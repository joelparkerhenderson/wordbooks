# Letter Of Intent (LOI)

A letter of intent (LOI), also known as a memorandum of understanding (MOU), is a document that outlines the preliminary understanding between two parties about a potential transaction or agreement.

Typical aspects:

* Parties involved: The names and contact information of who's involved.

* Description of the transaction: The nature of the transaction, including the product or service being provided, and the terms and conditions of the agreement.

* Timelines: The timeline for completing the transaction or agreement, including the start and end date.

* Financial terms: The proposed payment terms and any other financial arrangements, including the amount and timing.

* Confidentiality: A statement about the confidentiality of the information shared, including any proprietary information.

* Governing law: The state or jurisdiction that governs the LOI.

A letter of intent is typically non-binding, meaning that it does not create a legally enforceable agreement. It can be useful for negotiating a binding agreement in the future, and can serve as a sign of good faith and commitment between parties.

The LOI is often used in a variety of situations, such as mergers and acquisitions, real estate transactions, business partnerships, and employment agreements.
