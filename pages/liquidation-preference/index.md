# Liquidation preference

In the context of startup financing, liquidation preference refers to the order in which investors receive their share of the proceeds when a startup is acquired or goes public. Investors who have liquidation preference rights get paid first, before other shareholders. 

There are different types of liquidation preferences, such as:

* Non-participating: In this type, investors receive either their investment amount or the pro-rata share of the proceeds, whichever is higher. Once they receive their payout, they don't participate in the distribution of the remaining proceeds.

* Participating: In this type, investors receive their investment amount, then they participate in the distribution of the remaining proceeds according to their pro-rata share.

* Capped participating: This type is similar to the participating preference, but there is a cap on the amount of proceeds that the investor can receive.

Liquidation preference can have a significant impact on the payout received by investors and the value of the startup. Investors with liquidation preference have a lower risk, as they are guaranteed to receive their payout first. On the other hand, non-preferred shareholders, such as common shareholders, may receive little or nothing if the liquidation preference payout is too high. Therefore, liquidation preference is an important consideration for startups and investors during the fundraising process.
