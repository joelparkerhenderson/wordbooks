# Proof of capability (POC)

Proof of capability (POC) is a term used in business to describe a process that verifies the ability of a company or individual to deliver a product or service. It involves demonstrating that a company or individual has the necessary skills, expertise, resources, and capacity to complete a project or provide a service.

In contrast to proof of concept (POC), which tests the feasibility of a new idea or product, proof of capability (POC) is focused on testing the ability of an established company or individual to execute and deliver on their promises. It is often used as part of the procurement process for government or large-scale commercial contracts.

A proof of capability (POC) may involve a number of different activities, such as:

* Proposal development: The company or individual will need to develop a proposal that outlines their approach, methodology, timeline, and costs for delivering the product or service.

* Reference checks: The client may request references from past clients or customers to verify the quality of the company or individual's work.

* Site visits: The client may request to visit the company or individual's facilities to verify that they have the necessary infrastructure and resources to deliver the project.

* Skills assessments: The client may require the company or individual to undergo skills assessments or provide evidence of certifications and qualifications to verify that they have the necessary skills and expertise.

* Testing: The client may request that the company or individual demonstrate their capabilities through a small-scale test project or pilot program.

The goal of a proof of capability (POC) is to provide assurance to the client that the company or individual can deliver on their promises and meet the client's requirements. It can be an important step in the procurement process, helping to reduce the risk of selecting an unqualified vendor or service provider.
