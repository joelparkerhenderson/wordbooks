# Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow

"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" is a phrase coined by Eric S. Raymond. This phrase refers to the idea that with enough people looking at a software project, all bugs and defects in the software will eventually be found and fixed.

The phrase is based on the concept of open-source software development, where the source code of the software is made available to the public, allowing anyone to contribute to its development. In an open-source project, there are typically many developers and users who can view and modify the source code, which can lead to more eyes looking at the code and spotting potential issues.

The idea is that if enough people are involved in the development and use of a software project, then there will be enough eyes looking at the code to find and fix any bugs or defects in the software. This is in contrast to proprietary software development, where the source code is not publicly available, and therefore, fewer people have the opportunity to look at the code and spot bugs.

The concept has been used to support the argument that open-source software development can lead to more secure and stable software, as there are more people involved in the development process and more eyes looking for potential issues. However, it is important to note that this concept does not guarantee that all bugs will be found or that the software will be completely free of defects. It simply suggests that with more people involved in the development and use of the software, there is a greater likelihood that any bugs or defects will be identified and resolved.
