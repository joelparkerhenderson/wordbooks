# International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000)

International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) is a global standard developed by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) that provides guidelines and requirements for conducting assurance engagements that are not audits or reviews of financial statements. These engagements may include providing assurance on internal controls, sustainability reporting, or other non-financial information.

The ISAE 3000 standard provides a framework for conducting assurance engagements that is consistent with the principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, confidentiality, and due care. It includes the following key elements:

* Engagement acceptance and planning: The auditor must plan the engagement and assess the risks associated with the engagement to ensure that the appropriate level of assurance can be provided.

* Performance of the engagement: The auditor must perform procedures to gather evidence to support the conclusion that is to be reported.

* Reporting: The auditor must report on the results of the engagement and provide a conclusion that is supported by the evidence gathered during the engagement.

ISAE 3000 also requires that the auditor obtain an understanding of the entity's internal controls, and design and perform procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. The auditor must also communicate with the entity's management and, where appropriate, those charged with governance, to obtain relevant information and ensure that the engagement is properly planned and executed.

ISAE 3000 is applicable to a wide range of assurance engagements, including sustainability reporting, social responsibility reporting, and information technology (IT) audits. It is also relevant for other non-financial information that requires assurance, such as risk management, compliance, and corporate governance.
