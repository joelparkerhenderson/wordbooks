# Inventory turnover

Inventory turnover, also known as inventory turns, is a financial metric that measures how efficiently a company is managing its inventory. It is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory for a given period of time. The resulting number represents the number of times a company has sold and replaced its inventory during that period.

The formula for inventory turnover is:

Inventory turnover = COGS / Average inventory

The average inventory is calculated by adding the beginning and ending inventory for a period and dividing by two. This provides an estimate of the average amount of inventory that a company holds during a given period of time.

A higher inventory turnover ratio indicates that a company is selling its inventory more quickly, and therefore, managing its inventory more efficiently. This can result in lower carrying costs, reduced risk of inventory obsolescence, and increased cash flow. On the other hand, a lower inventory turnover ratio indicates that a company is selling its inventory more slowly, which can result in higher carrying costs, a higher risk of inventory obsolescence, and reduced cash flow.

Inventory turnover can vary significantly across different industries, depending on the nature of the business and the types of products being sold. For example, a company that sells perishable goods such as food or fashion items that are subject to changing trends may have a higher inventory turnover ratio than a company that sells durable goods such as appliances or furniture.
