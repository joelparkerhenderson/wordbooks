# Stock options

Stock options are a type of financial instrument that gives employees the right to purchase company stock at a fixed price within a certain timeframe. Stock options are typically used as part of an employee compensation package, and they allow employees to benefit from the company's success and growth.

When an employee is granted stock options, they are given the option to purchase a specific number of shares of company stock at a predetermined price, also known as the "strike price" or "exercise price." The strike price is typically based on the fair market value of the company's stock at the time the options are granted. The options typically have a set expiration date, after which they become worthless.

Once an employee exercises their options and purchases the shares of company stock, they can either hold onto the shares or sell them on the open market. If the value of the stock has gone up since the options were granted, the employee can sell the shares at a profit. However, if the stock has decreased in value, the employee may choose to hold onto the shares in the hopes that they will increase in value in the future.

There are two main types of stock options: incentive stock options (ISOs) and non-qualified stock options (NSOs). ISOs are generally more favorable from a tax perspective, as they are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate if the employee holds onto the shares for at least two years after the options were granted and one year after they were exercised. NSOs, on the other hand, are subject to ordinary income tax rates at the time they are exercised.

Stock options can be a valuable tool for companies looking to attract and retain top talent, while also giving employees a stake in the company's success. However, it's important for employees to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before exercising their options, as stock prices can be volatile and unpredictable.
