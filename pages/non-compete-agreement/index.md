# Non-compete agreement

A non-compete agreement is a legal contract between an employer and an employee that restricts the employee's ability to compete against the employer during and after their employment relationship ends. The agreement is typically signed when an employee is hired or when an employee is offered a promotion.

Non-compete agreements are designed to protect a company's business interests by preventing employees from taking what they learned from their employment and using it to compete against their former employer. In essence, the agreement is intended to prevent employees from using their knowledge, skills, and connections gained while working for a company to start their own competing business or work for a competitor.

The specific terms of a non-compete agreement can vary widely, but they typically prohibit an employee from working for a competitor for a certain period of time after leaving their current position. The agreement may also restrict the employee from soliciting customers or employees from their former employer or disclosing confidential information.

Non-compete agreements are subject to state laws and regulations, and the enforceability of such agreements can vary depending on the jurisdiction. Some states have very strict rules around non-compete agreements, while others may have more relaxed requirements. In general, non-compete agreements are more likely to be enforceable if they are reasonable in scope, time, and geographic area.

It is important for employees to carefully review any non-compete agreement before signing it to fully understand its terms and implications. If an employee violates a non-compete agreement, they may be subject to legal action, including injunctions, monetary damages, and even criminal charges in some cases.
