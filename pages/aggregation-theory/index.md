# Aggregation theory

Aggregation theory is a concept in business that describes how value is created in the digital economy through the aggregation and distribution of data. The theory was introduced by Ben Thompson in his book "Stratechery" and has become increasingly popular in the tech industry.

At its core, aggregation theory states that the most successful companies in the digital economy are those that are able to aggregate the demand of consumers or suppliers, and then leverage that aggregation to create a marketplace where transactions can take place. In other words, companies that are able to bring together large numbers of consumers or suppliers in a single platform are able to extract value from that platform by facilitating transactions.

One example of aggregation theory in action is the ride-sharing company Uber. By aggregating the demand for ride-sharing services and providing a platform for drivers and passengers to connect, Uber has been able to create a highly profitable business model that has disrupted the traditional taxi industry.

Another example is the e-commerce giant Amazon. By aggregating millions of buyers and sellers on its platform, Amazon has been able to create a massive marketplace that generates billions of dollars in revenue every year.

According to aggregation theory, the key to success in the digital economy is to focus on building platforms that are able to aggregate demand or supply, rather than focusing solely on creating products or services. By doing so, companies can create powerful network effects that make it difficult for competitors to enter the market.
