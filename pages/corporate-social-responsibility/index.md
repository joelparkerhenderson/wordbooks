# Corporate social responsibility (CSR)

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to a company's efforts to act ethically and responsibly towards society, the environment, and its stakeholders. CSR involves taking responsibility for the impact that a company's operations have on these various areas and ensuring that the company is making a positive contribution. This may include actions such as minimizing the company's carbon footprint, promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace, providing fair working conditions for employees, and contributing to charitable causes.

CSR is increasingly seen as a crucial component of business strategy, with many companies now viewing it as a way to improve their reputation, attract and retain customers, and differentiate themselves from competitors. It is also seen as a way to mitigate risk, as companies that are seen as socially responsible may be less likely to face public backlash or regulatory action.

There are several frameworks and standards that guide companies in developing and implementing CSR strategies. One such framework is the United Nations Global Compact, which outlines ten principles in areas such as human rights, labor rights, and environmental sustainability. The ISO 26000 standard also provides guidance on implementing CSR practices.

Some examples of CSR initiatives that companies may undertake include:

* Environmental sustainability: Companies may reduce their environmental impact by implementing sustainable practices such as using renewable energy, reducing waste, and promoting energy efficiency.

* Community involvement: Companies may engage with local communities by supporting local charities, sponsoring community events, or providing educational or job opportunities.

* Ethical business practices: Companies may ensure that their business practices are ethical, for example by avoiding exploitative labor practices, using fair trade suppliers, and ensuring that their products are safe and of high quality.

* Diversity and inclusion: Companies may promote diversity and inclusion by ensuring that their workforce is representative of the communities they serve and by creating an inclusive work environment that values all employees.
