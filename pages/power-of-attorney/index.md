# Power Of Attorney (POA)

A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that allows an individual, referred to as the "principal," to grant someone else, known as the "agent" or "attorney-in-fact," the legal authority to act on their behalf. The agent can perform specific tasks or make decisions on behalf of the principal, as outlined in the POA document. The agent is legally bound to act in the best interests of the principal and must follow any specific instructions outlined in the POA.

There are two main types of POAs: general and specific. A general POA gives the agent broad authority to act on the principal's behalf, while a specific POA limits the agent's authority to a particular task or set of tasks. For example, a specific POA might authorize the agent to sell a specific piece of property on behalf of the principal.

POAs can be either durable or non-durable. A durable POA remains in effect even if the principal becomes incapacitated or unable to make decisions for themselves. A non-durable POA is only valid as long as the principal is mentally competent and able to make decisions for themselves.

POAs are commonly used in a variety of situations, such as estate planning, business transactions, and healthcare decision-making. In the case of healthcare decision-making, a healthcare POA is used to designate an agent to make medical decisions on behalf of the principal if they become unable to do so themselves.

It is important to note that granting someone a POA can have significant legal and financial implications, and it is important to carefully consider the decision and seek legal advice if necessary. Additionally, it is important to choose an agent who is trustworthy and capable of acting in the best interests of the principal.
