# First-mover advantage

First-mover advantage is a concept in business strategy that refers to the competitive advantage a company gains by being the first to enter a market or introduce a new product or service. In general, the first mover has the opportunity to establish brand recognition, build customer loyalty, and capture a significant share of the market before competitors can catch up.

One of the key advantages of being a first mover is the ability to set the standards for the market. By introducing a new product or service, the first mover can shape customer expectations and create a brand that is associated with innovation and leadership. This can lead to a higher level of customer loyalty, as customers may be more likely to remain loyal to a brand that they perceive as being at the forefront of the market.

Another advantage of being a first mover is that it allows a company to establish relationships with suppliers and distributors before competitors can. This can help to secure better pricing and terms for the company, as well as ensure a more reliable supply chain. Additionally, by having established relationships with key suppliers and distributors, the first mover can make it more difficult for competitors to enter the market, as they may face greater barriers to entry.

However, being a first mover also comes with risks. One of the key risks is that the market may not be ready for the product or service being offered, and the company may face significant obstacles in trying to establish a customer base. Additionally, being a first mover often requires significant investment in research and development, marketing, and distribution, which can be a significant financial burden.

Furthermore, once a first mover has established itself in a market, it may face challenges from competitors who are able to learn from the first mover's mistakes and improve upon their products or services. These competitors may be able to enter the market with lower costs, better products, or more effective marketing strategies, and may be able to capture market share from the first mover.
