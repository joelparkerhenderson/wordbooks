# Facility Use/Service Agreement (FUSA)

A Facility Use/Service Agreement (FUSA) is a legal agreement between a facility owner or service provider and a customer or tenant that specifies the terms and conditions of using the facility or receiving the services. The FUSA may also be referred to as a Facility Use Agreement, Facility Rental Agreement, Service Agreement, or Service Contract.

The FUSA typically covers the following aspects of the facility use or service provision:

* Scope of Services: This section specifies the nature and extent of the services to be provided by the service provider or the use of the facility by the customer. The description of services should be clear, precise, and comprehensive, with details on the frequency, duration, and quality of the services.

* Fees and Payment: The FUSA outlines the fees that the customer must pay for using the facility or receiving the services. The fees could be one-time, periodic, or variable based on usage or duration. The payment terms and conditions, including due dates, methods of payment, and penalties for late payments, are also specified in the agreement.

* Duration and Termination: This section specifies the start and end dates of the FUSA and the conditions for terminating the agreement by either party. The reasons for termination, notice periods, and the consequences of termination are also mentioned.

* Obligations and Responsibilities: This section outlines the obligations and responsibilities of both parties, including the service provider's duties to maintain the facility or provide the services and the customer's duties to comply with the rules and regulations, use the facility responsibly, and pay the fees on time.

* Liability and Insurance: The FUSA specifies the liability of each party for any damages, losses, or injuries arising from the use of the facility or provision of services. The need for insurance coverage, the type of insurance, and the amount of coverage required are also mentioned.

* Confidentiality and Intellectual Property: This section specifies the confidentiality and intellectual property rights of both parties, including the non-disclosure of sensitive information, the protection of trade secrets and proprietary information, and the ownership of any intellectual property created during the term of the FUSA.

* Dispute Resolution: The FUSA outlines the methods for resolving any disputes that may arise between the parties, such as mediation or arbitration, and the jurisdiction and venue for any legal proceedings.

A Facility Use/Service Agreement protects the interests of both parties and helps to establish a clear understanding of the terms and conditions of the facility use or service provision.
