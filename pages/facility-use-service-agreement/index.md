# Facility Use/Service Agreement (FUSA)

A Facility Use/Service Agreement (FUSA) is a legal agreement between a facility owner or service provider and a customer or tenant that specifies the terms and conditions of using the facility or receiving the services. The FUSA may also be referred to as a Facility Use Agreement, Facility Rental Agreement, Service Agreement, or Service Contract.

A FUSA typically covers the following aspects:

* Scope. Specify the nature and extent of the services to be provided by the service provider or the use of the facility by the customer. Be clear, precise, and comprehensive, with details on the frequency, duration, and quality.

* Compensation. Specify fees and payments for use. The fees could be one-time, periodic, or variable based on usage or duration. Specify payment terms and conditions, methods, due dates, and late penalties.

* Duration and Termination: Specify the start and end dates of the FUSA and the conditions for terminating the agreement by either party. The reasons for termination, notice periods, and the consequences of termination are also mentioned.

* Responsibilities: Specify the obligations of parties, including the provider's duties to maintain the facility or provide the services, and the customer's duties to comply with rules and regulations to use the facility responsibly.

* Liability: Specify actions for any damages, losses, or injuries arising from the use of the facility or provision of services. Include needs for insurance, the type of insurance, and the amount of coverage.

* Confidentiality and Intellectual Property: Specify rights of both parties for non-disclosure of sensitive information, protection of proprietary information, and ownership of any intellectual property created during FUSA.
