# Traction

In the context of a startup business, traction refers to the measurable progress a company has made toward achieving its business goals. It indicates the level of customer interest, product-market fit, revenue, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) that demonstrate the viability of a business.

Traction can be measured in various ways, such as the number of customers, revenue generated, user engagement, and retention rates. The type of traction that matters most to a startup depends on its business model and goals.

For example, a startup focused on building a large user base may measure traction by the number of downloads, registered users, or active users on its platform. On the other hand, a startup that generates revenue through sales may measure traction by the amount of revenue generated, the number of paying customers, or the average order value.

The importance of traction for startups cannot be overstated. It is a critical factor in attracting investors, gaining media attention, and recruiting talent. Traction is often used as a proxy for the overall health and potential of a startup, and is a key metric that investors use to determine whether or not to invest.

To achieve traction, startups must focus on building a product that solves a real problem for a specific customer segment, and must iterate and improve their product based on customer feedback. They must also focus on effective marketing and sales strategies to reach their target audience and drive growth.

In summary, traction is a critical metric for startups to track and improve upon. It demonstrates the viability of a business, and is a key factor in attracting investors, gaining media attention, and recruiting talent. Startups should focus on building a great product, iterating based on customer feedback, and executing effective marketing and sales strategies to achieve traction.
