# Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) 

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is a metric in business that helps companies evaluate the amount of money they need to spend on acquiring a new customer. It is the total cost that a business incurs to acquire a single customer, and it includes all the expenses involved in marketing, advertising, and sales activities.

To calculate CAC, a company divides the total cost of sales and marketing by the number of new customers gained in a particular time period. For example, if a company spent $100,000 on sales and marketing in a quarter and gained 1,000 new customers, the CAC would be $100.

The CAC metric is crucial because it helps businesses understand the effectiveness of their marketing and sales efforts. A low CAC indicates that a business is effectively acquiring customers, while a high CAC may indicate inefficiencies in marketing or sales strategies. A high CAC can also be an indication that the company needs to focus on increasing customer retention or improving the customer experience to reduce the cost of customer acquisition.

CAC can also help businesses determine the return on investment (ROI) of their marketing campaigns. By comparing the CAC to the lifetime value (LTV) of a customer, a company can assess the profitability of acquiring new customers. If the LTV is greater than the CAC, the company is making a profit on customer acquisition, but if the CAC is higher than the LTV, the company is losing money on acquiring new customers.
