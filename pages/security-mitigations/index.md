# Security mitigations

Security mitigations refer to the measures or actions taken to reduce or eliminate security risks and vulnerabilities in software. These can be both proactive and reactive, designed to prevent security threats before they happen or respond to them once they have been detected.

There are many different types of security mitigations that can be implemented in software development, including:

* Input validation: This involves checking the input data for correctness and preventing malicious inputs that could trigger security vulnerabilities or attacks.

* Encryption: This involves using algorithms to convert data into a coded form, making it unreadable to anyone without the decryption key.

* Access control: This involves setting permissions and restrictions on who can access specific resources, data or functions in the software.

* Authentication and authorization: This involves verifying the identity of users and ensuring that they have the appropriate level of access and permissions.

* Auditing and logging: This involves monitoring the software for unusual or suspicious activity and creating logs or records of that activity for analysis.

* Patching and updates: This involves regularly updating the software to address any known security vulnerabilities or issues.

* Reducing attack surface: This involves removing or disabling unnecessary features, functions or components that could potentially be exploited by attackers.

Security mitigations are an essential part of any software development process and should be incorporated from the beginning of the software development lifecycle. These measures help to ensure that the software is more secure and less vulnerable to attack, which can help protect users' data and prevent costly breaches or attacks.
