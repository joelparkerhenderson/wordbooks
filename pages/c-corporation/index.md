# C-Corporation

A C-Corporation, or C-Corp for short, is a type of legal structure used by businesses in the United States. It is a distinct legal entity that is separate from its owners (known as shareholders) and can enter into contracts, sue or be sued, and own assets and liabilities.

One of the main benefits of forming a C-Corp is that it offers limited liability protection to its shareholders. This means that the personal assets of shareholders are typically protected from the debts and liabilities of the corporation. Additionally, a C-Corp can issue multiple classes of stock, allowing for greater flexibility in raising capital and structuring ownership.

C-Corps are subject to more complex tax regulations compared to other business entities, such as pass-through entities like sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations. C-Corps are taxed as separate entities, and the corporation pays corporate income tax on its profits. Shareholders must also pay taxes on any dividends they receive. This means that C-Corps are generally subject to "double taxation" - the corporation pays taxes on its profits and shareholders also pay taxes on any dividends they receive.

C-Corps are required to follow certain formalities, such as holding annual meetings and maintaining accurate records of business transactions. They also have more regulatory requirements and typically require more paperwork to form and maintain compared to other business structures.

Overall, C-Corps are a popular choice for businesses that anticipate significant growth and seek to raise capital through the sale of stock. However, they may not be the best option for every business, as the tax implications and regulatory requirements can be more burdensome compared to other business entities. It is important to consult with a lawyer or accountant when deciding on the best legal structure for a business.
