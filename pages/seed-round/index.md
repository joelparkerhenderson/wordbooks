# Seed round 

A seed round is a type of financing that takes place in the early stages of a startup's development. It typically occurs after the startup has completed its initial product development and is seeking funding to support further growth and expansion.

Seed rounds are often the first round of financing that a startup receives, and they are typically provided by angel investors or early-stage venture capital firms. The amount of funding provided in a seed round can vary widely, but is typically in the range of $100,000 to $2 million.

The funds provided in a seed round are typically used to support a startup's growth and development, including hiring employees, marketing and advertising, and product development. In exchange for their investment, seed round investors typically receive an equity stake in the company.

Seed rounds can be a critical source of funding for early-stage startups, as they can help to provide the financial resources needed to develop and grow the business. They can also help to attract additional investors and provide validation to potential customers and partners.

However, seed rounds also come with risks for investors, as many early-stage startups fail to achieve success. As such, seed round investors should be prepared to accept a high level of risk and should carefully evaluate the startup's potential for success before making an investment.
