# Y Combinator (YC)

Y Combinator (YC) (<https://ycombinator.com>) is a startup accelerator that provides seed funding, mentorship, and resources to early-stage companies. It was founded in March 2005 by Paul Graham, Robert Morris, Trevor Blackwell, and Jessica Livingston.

The program typically lasts for three months and provides startups with funding, office space, and access to a network of advisors and potential investors. The program culminates in a demo day, where the companies present their products to a room full of investors and media.

Since its founding, Y Combinator has helped launch several successful startups, including Airbnb, Dropbox, Reddit, and Stripe. Y Combinator has also developed a reputation for providing valuable mentorship and advice to its startups, with founders frequently citing the program as a crucial factor in their success.

In addition to its accelerator program, Y Combinator has also launched several other initiatives, including a startup school that provides free online resources to entrepreneurs, a research lab that conducts studies on entrepreneurship and technology, and a venture capital fund that invests in Y Combinator alumni.

One of the unique aspects of Y Combinator is its focus on the startup community as a whole. The program encourages founders to share their experiences and knowledge with others, and it has become a hub for networking and collaboration among startups.
