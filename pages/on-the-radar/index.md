# On the radar

"On the radar" is an idiom that means something or someone is being monitored, watched, or considered for future reference or action. The phrase comes from the idea of a radar system that detects objects in the distance and allows them to be monitored and tracked over time.

It can also be used to describe a person or a company that is gaining prominence or recognition and is worth keeping an eye on for future developments or collaboration.
