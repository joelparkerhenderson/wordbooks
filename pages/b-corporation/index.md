# B-Corporation

A B-Corporation, or B-Corp for short, is a type of for-profit business that has committed to meeting rigorous social and environmental standards. B-Corps are certified by the nonprofit organization B Lab, which evaluates a company's performance in areas such as environmental sustainability, employee relations, and community involvement.

To become a B-Corp, a company must complete the B Impact Assessment, which is a comprehensive evaluation of the company's impact on its stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, and the environment. The assessment covers areas such as governance, worker compensation and benefits, supply chain practices, and environmental sustainability.

Companies that meet the minimum standards for social and environmental performance are then required to amend their legal governing documents to include a commitment to consider the impact of their decisions on their stakeholders, and to publish an annual report on their social and environmental performance.

B-Corps are designed to be more than just businesses that make a profit. They are committed to using their business practices as a force for good, and to making a positive impact on the world. This may involve making investments in sustainable technologies, implementing fair labor practices, or donating a portion of their profits to charitable causes.

B-Corps are also required to meet high standards of transparency and accountability. They are required to undergo a recertification process every three years to ensure that they continue to meet the standards set by B Lab.
