# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data privacy regulation by the European Union (EU). GDPR is intended to harmonize data protection laws across the EU, and to provide individuals with greater control over their personal data.

The GDPR applies to all organizations, regardless of their location, that process the personal data of individuals within the EU. Personal data is defined as any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual, such as a name, email address, or IP address.

Key areas of the GDPR:

* Obtaining consent: Organizations must obtain explicit and informed consent from individuals before collecting and processing their personal data.

* Transparency: Organizations must provide individuals with clear concise information about how their data is being processed.

* Data portability: Individuals have the right to receive a copy of their personal data and to transfer it to another organization.

* Right to erasure: Individuals have the right to request that their personal data be erased.

* Data breach notification: Organizations must notify individuals and the relevant authorities of any data breaches that may affect their personal data.

* Accountability: Organizations must be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.

The GDPR also includes strict penalties for non-compliance, with fines of up to â‚¬20 million or 4% of a company's global annual revenue.
