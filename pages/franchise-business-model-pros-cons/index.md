# Franchise business model pros/cons

The franchise business model has several advantages for both the franchisor and franchisee, including:

* Established brand: The franchisor has already established a successful brand and business model, which can help the franchisee attract customers and build a loyal customer base.

* Reduced risk: The franchisee benefits from reduced risk, as they are operating a proven business model with an established customer base.

* Training and support: The franchisor provides training and support to help the franchisee operate their business successfully, which can help inexperienced business owners achieve success.

* Economies of scale: The franchisor can achieve economies of scale by sharing resources such as marketing materials and operational manuals with multiple franchisees.

However, the franchise business model also has some disadvantages, including:

* Limited flexibility: The franchisee must follow the franchisor's established brand and business model, which can limit their flexibility in operating their business.

* Ongoing fees: The franchisee must pay ongoing royalties to the franchisor, which can impact their profitability.

* Reputation risk: If a franchisee operates their business poorly or engages in unethical behavior, it can reflect poorly on the entire franchise system and damage the franchisor's brand.
