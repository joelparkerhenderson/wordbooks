# Patent

A patent is a form of intellectual property that grants an inventor the exclusive right to make, use, and sell their invention for a certain period of time, usually 20 years from the patent application filing date. A patent provides legal prevents others from making, using, selling, or importing the invention without the permission of the patent holder.

To obtain a patent, an inventor must file a patent application with the patent office. The application outlines the details of the invention, including how it works, and what makes it novel, non-obvious, and useful.

There are three main types of patents:

* Utility patents: These are the most common type of patent and cover new and useful processes, machines, articles of manufacture, and compositions of matter.

* Design patents: These patents protect the ornamental design of a functional item, such as the shape of a car or the design of a smartphone.

* Plant patents: These patents protect new varieties of plants that have been asexually reproduced.

Once a patent is granted, the patent holder can take legal action against anyone who infringes on their patent rights. This can include filing a lawsuit to stop the infringing activity and seeking damages for any harm caused by the infringement.

Patents can be valuable assets for inventors and companies, as they provide a legal monopoly on the invention and can be licensed or sold to generate income. However, obtaining a patent can be a complex and expensive process, and patents may be challenged or invalidated by others who believe that they have the right to use the invention. Inventors should work with legal experts to navigate the patent system and protect their inventions.
