# Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions (RAID)

Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions (RAID) is a tactic used in project management. A RAID log is a document that lists all the known potential risks, actions, issues, and decisions related to a project, and provides a way to monitor their progress and ensure that they are addressed.

Each element of a RAID log serves a specific purpose:

* Risks: Risks are potential events that could have a negative impact on the project. The RAID log includes a list of identified risks, the likelihood of each risk occurring, the potential impact of each risk, and the steps that will be taken to mitigate or manage each risk.

* Actions: Actions are tasks that need to be completed to keep the project on track. The RAID log includes a list of actions that need to be taken, who is responsible for each action, the target date for completion, and the status of each action.

* Issues: Issues are problems that arise during the project that need to be addressed. The RAID log includes a list of identified issues, the impact of each issue on the project, who is responsible for addressing each issue, and the status of each issue.

* Decisions: Decisions are choices made by the project team that impact the direction of the project. The RAID log includes a list of decisions that have been made, who made the decision, the date the decision was made, and the impact of the decision on the project.

The RAID log is typically updated and reviewed regularly by the project team to ensure that all potential risks, actions, issues, and decisions are being tracked and addressed appropriately. The log can be used as a tool for communication with stakeholders to keep them informed about the project's progress and any potential concerns.

By using a RAID log, project managers can proactively identify potential risks and take steps to mitigate or manage them before they become major issues. It also provides a central location for tracking all important information related to the project, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks. Overall, the RAID log is a valuable tool for project managers to ensure the success of their projects.
