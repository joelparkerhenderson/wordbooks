# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of access control that restricts access to system resources based on the roles that individual users perform within an organization. It is a widely used access control model that provides security by separating user access based on their roles.

In an RBAC system, users are assigned roles based on their responsibilities within the organization. Roles define the set of permissions or access rights that are associated with a particular job function or position. Users are granted access to system resources based on their assigned roles. This helps to ensure that users only have access to the resources they need to perform their job function.

RBAC provides several advantages over traditional access control methods, such as discretionary access control (DAC) and mandatory access control (MAC). One of the key advantages of RBAC is that it simplifies the administration of user privileges. Instead of managing user permissions individually, administrators can assign roles to groups of users and manage permissions at the role level. This makes it easier to ensure that users have the appropriate level of access to system resources.

RBAC also provides a high degree of flexibility in terms of managing user access. Roles can be easily modified or deleted, allowing organizations to adapt to changing business needs. In addition, RBAC can be extended to support new applications or technologies as they are introduced.

RBAC is a powerful access control mechanism that can help organizations to improve security, simplify administration, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to critical system resources.
