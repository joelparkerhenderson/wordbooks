Ad tech:
* Demand-side platforms (DSPs): These are software platforms that allow advertisers to buy ad inventory across multiple ad exchanges and supply-side platforms (SSPs) in real-time. DSPs use sophisticated algorithms to evaluate ad inventory and target audiences based on factors such as demographics, location, behavior, and device.

* Supply-side platforms (SSPs): These are software platforms that allow publishers to sell ad inventory across multiple ad exchanges and DSPs in real-time. SSPs use sophisticated algorithms to evaluate ad inventory and maximize revenue by optimizing the price and placement of ads.

* Data management platforms (DMPs):

* Property Management Software: This type of software can help property managers to manage their properties more efficiently by automating tasks such as rent collection, maintenance requests, and lease management.

accounting
                                            The process of contextualizing each transaction in order to present an accurate picture of the company&#8217;s financial performance. Accountants go beyond recording a transaction; they interpret how each transaction impacts the financial status of the business.
acquisition
                                            A process where a company acquires the controlling interest (more than 50%) of another company.
advisor
                                            An individual providing guidance, connections, advice and support to the entrepreneur, often in return for a small equity stake.
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
                                            A service that allows startups to cheaply rent server space and development tools in the cloud and scale up as needed rather than purchasing their own expensive servers.
angel group
                                            A formal or informal organization of individual accredited investors who pool their deal flow, resources, expertise and capital in order to make angel investments.
angel round
                                            A round of investment into a startup company from angel investors not previously affiliated with the founder. Typically the first money invested in a company after the founder&#8217;s own money and the founder&#8217;s friends and family.
Articles of Incorporation (or Certificate of Incorporation)
                                            Documents filed with the state&#8217;s Secretary of State or Registrar which acts as a charter to document the establishment and existence of a corporation—typically including the business&#8217;s name, address, a statement of business purpose, and details related to the types of stock the corporation is entitled to issue.

authorized shares
                                            The maximum number of shares that a company can issue, as decided by its Board of Directors. For a Delaware C-Corporation, any increases or decreases to this number require amending and restating the Certificate of Incorporation in Delaware. Gust Launch starts each company with 10 million authorized shares—a very common number to begin with.
bookkeeping
                                            The process of recording all of the company&#8217;s transactions in a set of books, also known as a ledger. Entries are recorded in accounting software, which will compile reports based on how bookkeepers tag such entries.

buyout
                                            The purchase of a company or a controlling interest of a corporation&#8217;s shares, product line or business. A leveraged buyout is an acquisition accomplished with borrowed money or by issuing more stock.
cap (on a convertible note)
                                            The maximum company valuation at which a convertible note will convert into a company&#8217;s stock.
cap table (capitalization table)
                                            A record of all securities and their shareholders commonly displayed in a fully diluted view.

cash flow statement
                                            Reconciles the beginning cash balance to the ending cash balance by illustrating the sources and uses of cash from operations, investing, and financing activities.
common stock
                                            A US term for a form of equity ownership of a company, equivalent to the terms “voting share” or “ordinary share” used in other parts of the world. In a liquidity event or a bankruptcy, common stockholders receive all of the net value of a company after paying the fixed amounts due to bondholders, creditors and preferred stockholders. Common stock usually carries with it the right to vote on certain matters, such as electing the board of directors.

                                            

convertible preferred stock
                                            Preferred stock in a company that is convertible at the option of the holder into common stock at a predetermined valuation. This provides the priority and security of holding preferred stock, as well as the potential value appreciation of common stock.
corporate venture
                                            An investment from one corporation in another, typically at an early stage for strategic reasons.
DBA Registration
                                            Allows you to conduct business in a name other than your own (or your company&#8217;s) legal name, and allows others to identify the person or entity behind the business name you&#8217;ve registered.

deal lead
                                            The investor or investment organization taking primary responsibility for organizing an investment round in a company. The deal lead typically finds the company, negotiates the terms of the investment, invests the largest amount and serves as the primary liaison between the company and the other investors.
debt
                                            Borrowed money that needs to be paid back. The entrepreneur rents the money for a specific period of time and promises to pay interest on the money for as long as the loan is outstanding.
dilution
                                            When a company sells additional shares of stock, thereby decreasing the percentage ownership of existing shareholders. Note that if the valuation of the new sale is at a high enough level, the value of stock held by existing investors may increase, even though the percentage ownership may decrease.

discounted convertible note
                                            A loan that converts into the same equity security being purchased in a future investment round, but at a discounted price representing a risk premium for the early investment.
duty of care
                                            A fiduciary duty of a board of directors that obligates board members to reasonably avail themselves of all material information before making a business decision.
duty of loyalty
                                            A fiduciary duty of a board of directors that requires a director to put the interests of the stockholders ahead of their own individual interests.

Employer Identification Number (EIN)
                                            A unique, 9-digit identification number utilized by the Internal Revenue Service, (IRS) and assigned to business entities to identify employers as part of the tax reporting process. In order to obtain an EIN, business entities must file or apply to the IRS.
entrepreneur
                                            A person who organizes and operates a business or businesses, taking on greater than normal financial risks to do so. Entrepreneurs are the founders of startups, and are the people angel investors support.

equity
                                            A corporation is divided into shares, which represent a slice of both the company itself and the value the company creates. These shares, once distributed, represent the company ownership (a word commonly interchanged with equity).

equity seed round
                                            <div id="equity-seed-round" class="term">When an entrepreneur first sells a part of his or her business— and therefore a proportional part of the good things (like profits) and the not-so-good things (like losses)—to an investor. Equity investments, unlike loans, do not need to be paid back.</div>
exit
                                            When a company is either acquired for cash, sold during a public offering, or abandoned as a failed venture.
Form K-1
                                            A tax document that explains to the IRS the attributed income received by partners in a partnership. As hybrid of a partnership and a C-Corp, LLCs demand that all “partners” file K-1s annually.
founders stock (or founder&#8217;s equity)
                                            The common stock owned by one or more of a company&#8217;s founders, typically received when the company was incorporated.

franchise tax
                                            A yearly tax for conducting business as a separate legal “person” from its owners.

                                            

friends &#038; family round
                                            An investment in a company that often follows the founder&#8217;s own investment, from people who are investing primarily because of their relationship with the founder rather than their knowledge of the business.

fully diluted shares
                                            All stock (common and preferred) and issued options (or warrants) as if converted to common stock. This is less relevant in the early days, but it&#8217;s a representation that investors care about as it most accurately reflects preferences, rights, and decisions made during a liquidity event (e.g. an acquisition or IPO).
funding platform
                                            Any online website used to facilitate investments in private companies. As a defined term, a specific type of platform defined by the JOBS Act of 2012 that will allow non-accredited investors to invest in private offerings
grant
                                            Money provided by a government agency or other organization that does not need to be repaid and does not purchase equity.
incubator
                                            A program or shared office center designed to support the successful development of companies by offering cost effective resources and support.
independent contractor
                                            A specific classification of worker that is not an employee of the company. Usually distinguished by 1) whether the business has a right to direct and control how the worker does the task for which the worker is hired, 2) whether the company has a right to control the business aspects of the worker’s job, and 3) what kind of relationship the worker has to the business.

investment round
                                            A set of one or more investments made in a particular company, by one or more investors on essentially similar terms at essentially the same time.

issued shares
                                            The total number of shares that have been granted by the company and purchased by a shareholder. These are also commonly referred to as issued and outstanding shares.

lead investor
                                            See deal lead.
liquidation waterfall
                                            The sequence in which all parties, including investors, employees, creditors and others, receive payouts in the event of a company&#8217;s liquidation through acquisition or bankruptcy.

Main Street business
                                            A colloquial term used to describe traditional small, local retail and service companies. They typically serve local markets, provide jobs and benefit the local economy, but are usually not high-growth industries or eventual targets for investment or acquisition by larger companies.
major investor
                                            As used in investment term sheets, any investor who puts in more than a defined amount into a given round, and is therefore entitled to specific information and/or voting rights.
micro-VC
                                            The correct term for organizations often referred to as “super angels.” Structured similarly to a traditional venture fund, a Micro-VC is typically much smaller in size, with fewer partners, and invests less money but at an earlier stage.
option pool
                                            An allocation of shares reserved to be granted as options via a company&#8217;s equity incentive plan (or stock option plan). You can also issue other derivatives from this reserved pool (e.g. warrants, RSAs, RSUs, etc).
options
                                            A different way of distributing ownership-options are the right to buy shares based on a set of conditions. When an option is “exercised,” the option to buy stock is used and the result is issued shares. They&#8217;re typically used as part of a compensation package in the form of an incentive to employees, directors, advisors, and other people key to the company&#8217;s success.

peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending)
                                            A type of online financing solution through which individuals lend money to other individuals or small businesses.
pitch
                                            A presentation, typically supported by slides, in which a startup company&#8217;s founder describes his or her company and seeks an investment from angels or venture capitalists.

                                            

portfolio
                                            A collection of companies invested in by an angel or VC.

preferred stock
                                            A type of equity ownership of a company that has both a fixed value and priority in liquidation sequence.
private companies
                                            Companies that are not publicly traded on the stock market.
public companies
                                            Companies that are freely traded on the public stock exchanges such as NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.
QSBS exemption
                                            The Qualified Small Business Stock exemption allows a C-Corp&#8217;s stockholders to—under specific circumstances—write off 100% of personal taxes up to $10,000,000 after five years of ownership.

Quora
                                            A leading question-and-answer website where questions are answered by industry experts in entrepreneurship, investing, and other fields.
representations and warranties
                                            A list of material statements or facts included in the investment documentation to which the entrepreneur unequivocally commits.
runway
                                            How long a startup can survive before it goes broke; that is, the amount of cash in the bank divided by the burn rate.
