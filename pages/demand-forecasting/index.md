# Demand forecasting

Demand forecasting is a process used by businesses to predict the future demand for their products or services. This process involves analyzing internal factors like historical sales data and customer behavior, and external factors like economic conditions and the competitive landscape.

Demand forecasting helps businesses plan and allocate resources, such as for production schedules, capacity capabilities, inventory levels, pricing strategies, and marketing budgets, all to meet the anticipated demand.

Some of the typical methods of demand forecasting:

* Qualitative forecasting: This method uses expert opinion, customer surveys, and market research to predict future demand. It is useful when historical data is not available, or the product or service is new to the market.

* Time-series forecasting: This method involves analyzing historical sales data to identify patterns and trends and extrapolating them into the future. It is useful when there is a stable and predictable demand pattern.

* Causal forecasting: This method analyzes the relationship between demand and external factors such as economic indicators, demographics, and market trends. It is useful when there is a significant impact of external factors on demand.
