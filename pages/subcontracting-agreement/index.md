# Subcontracting agreement

A subcontracting agreement is a legal agreement between two parties, where one party, known as the subcontractor, agrees to perform a specific portion of work or services for the other party, known as the prime contractor. The prime contractor is responsible for delivering the project or contract to the client, and they may hire one or more subcontractors to perform specific tasks or services related to the project.

Subcontracting is common in industries such as construction, engineering, software development, and many others, where large or complex projects require the expertise of multiple companies or individuals with specialized skills. Subcontractors are often hired to provide specific services, such as electrical work, plumbing, or software development, that are outside the scope of the prime contractor's expertise.

A subcontracting agreement typically includes the same sections as a consulting agreement: scope, schedule, compensation, confidentiality, termination, governing law, liability, insurance, liability, indemnification, and non-compete clauses.

Subcontracting agreements are important because they help to define the relationship between the prime contractor and the subcontractor, and ensure that both parties have a clear understanding of their responsibilities and obligations. They also help to mitigate the risks associated with subcontracting, by providing a legal framework for resolving any disputes that may arise during the course of the project.
