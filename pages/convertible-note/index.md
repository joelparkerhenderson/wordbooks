# Convertible note

A convertible note is a type of short-term debt financing commonly used by startups, which can be converted into equity at a later date. It is essentially a loan that converts into equity when a certain event, such as a future funding round or an acquisition, takes place. Convertible notes are usually issued to early-stage investors who provide seed funding to startups.

The key features of a convertible note include:

* Interest rate: Convertible notes typically have a low interest rate, usually ranging from 2% to 8% per annum.

* Maturity date: The maturity date is the date on which the loan becomes due and payable. Convertible notes usually have a maturity date of 18 to 24 months from the date of issuance.

* Conversion discount: A conversion discount is a discount offered to investors when they convert their debt into equity. The conversion discount is usually in the range of 10% to 20%.

* Conversion cap: A conversion cap is a maximum valuation at which the debt can be converted into equity. The conversion cap protects investors from being diluted if the company has a high valuation at the time of conversion.

* Equity conversion: Convertible notes can be converted into equity at a later date, usually during a future funding round or an acquisition. The conversion price is usually set at a discount to the future valuation of the company.

* Repayment: If the startup is unable to raise funds or is unable to meet the repayment obligations, the convertible note may be converted into equity, or it may be repaid with interest.

Convertible notes are popular among startups because they offer a way to raise capital without having to agree on a valuation, which can be difficult in the early stages of a startup. Additionally, convertible notes offer flexibility to investors, who can choose to convert their debt into equity or receive a return on their investment if the startup is unable to raise funds.

However, convertible notes also have some drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that they can be complex, and the terms of the note can be difficult to understand. Additionally, convertible notes can be expensive, as they typically come with a range of legal fees and administrative costs. Finally, convertible notes can lead to dilution of the ownership of the company, as they convert to equity at a future date.
