# “Superbosses” by Sydney Finkelstein 

“Superbosses: How Exceptional Leaders Master the Flow of Talent” is a book by Sydney Finkelstein that explores the qualities and practices of exceptional leaders who have a track record of developing talented individuals into successful professionals. The author examines how these leaders identify, motivate, and cultivate talent, and how their strategies lead to long-term success for both the individual and the organization.

The book is based on extensive research and interviews with more than 200 people, including superstars such as Ralph Lauren, Larry Ellison, and Bill Walsh. Finkelstein identifies three key qualities that all superbosses share: extreme confidence, a willingness to break rules, and a deep commitment to finding and cultivating talent.

Finkelstein also delves into the strategies that superbosses use to identify and develop talent, such as encouraging autonomy and risk-taking, providing opportunities for stretch assignments and cross-functional experiences, and creating a culture of high expectations and accountability. He also explores the importance of providing constructive feedback, creating a sense of belonging and community, and balancing the needs of the individual with the needs of the organization.
