# Discounted cash flow (DCF)

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is a financial modeling technique used to determine the intrinsic value of a company or investment based on its expected future cash flows. It is commonly used to determine the value of a business or an investment, especially in the context of mergers and acquisitions, venture capital, and private equity.

DCF analysis involves projecting future cash flows over a period of time and discounting those cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate, which represents the cost of capital required to finance the investment. The discount rate takes into account the risk associated with the investment and the time value of money.

The first step in a DCF analysis is to estimate the future cash flows of the investment or business. This requires forecasting revenues, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and other cash flows over a period of time, usually five to ten years. These projections are then discounted back to their present value using the discount rate.

The discount rate used in a DCF analysis depends on the risk profile of the investment. For example, a high-risk investment would require a higher discount rate to account for the increased risk, while a low-risk investment would require a lower discount rate.

The final step in a DCF analysis is to calculate the present value of the future cash flows and subtract the initial investment or purchase price to arrive at the net present value (NPV) of the investment. Positive NPV means expect profit. Negative NPV means expect loss.

DCF analysis is a useful tool for analysis because it provides a more accurate and objective assessment of the value of an investment or business than other valuation methods, such as market multiples or book value. However, DCF analysis has its limitations, including the reliance on accurate and realistic cash flow projections and the subjective nature of the discount rate.
