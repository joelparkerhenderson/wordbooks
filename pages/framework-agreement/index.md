# Framework agreement

A framework agreement, also known as a master agreement, is a type of contract that establishes the terms and conditions for future transactions between two or more parties. It is a pre-negotiated agreement that sets out the general terms and conditions that will govern a series of transactions or relationships between the parties.

A framework agreement is commonly used in business transactions where there is an ongoing need for goods or services. It allows the parties to agree on the key terms and conditions that will govern their relationship over an extended period of time, rather than negotiating each individual transaction separately.

The framework agreement typically includes provisions for pricing, delivery, quality standards, warranties, and other terms and conditions that will apply to all transactions conducted under the agreement. It may also include provisions for dispute resolution and termination of the agreement.

One of the key benefits of a framework agreement is that it can help to streamline the transaction process by reducing the time and effort required to negotiate each individual transaction. This can be particularly useful in situations where there is a high volume of transactions or where the transactions are complex and require significant negotiation.

Another benefit of a framework agreement is that it can provide greater certainty and predictability for both parties. By establishing the general terms and conditions upfront, the parties can avoid misunderstandings and disagreements that may arise later in the relationship.

A framework agreement can be an effective way for parties to establish a long-term relationship and streamline their transactions, while also providing greater certainty and predictability for both parties. However, it is important for parties to carefully negotiate and draft the agreement to ensure that it reflects their intentions and accurately captures the key terms and conditions of their relationship.
