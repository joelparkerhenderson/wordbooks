# S-Corporation

An S-Corporation (S-Corp) is a type of business structure that combines the benefits of a corporation with the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship. S-Corps are named for the United States Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Subchapter S.

One of the main advantages of an S-Corp is that it provides limited liability protection to its owners, similar to a traditional corporation. This means that the personal assets of the owners are generally protected from the liabilities and debts of the business.

Another advantage of an S-Corp is that it allows the company's income and losses to be passed through to the shareholders, who report these amounts on their individual tax returns. This means that the company is not taxed on its profits at the corporate level. This avoids the double taxation that can occur with a traditional corporation.

To qualify as an S-Corp, a business must meet certain eligibility requirements, including having no more than 100 shareholders and only one class of stock. Additionally, all shareholders must be be U.S. citizens or residents, or certain types of trusts or estates.

One disadvantage of an S-Corp is that it requires more formalities and paperwork than some other business structures, such as a sole proprietorship or partnership. S-Corps must file annual tax returns with the IRS, hold regular meetings of shareholders and directors, and maintain records of these meetings and other corporate activities. 

Another disadvantage is that S-Corps are subject to some restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares, which can make it more difficult to raise capital or sell the business.

An S-Corporation can be a good choice for small businesses that want the limited liability protection of a corporation but prefer the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship. However, it is important to carefully consider before choosing this type of business structure.
