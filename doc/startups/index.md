Agile
This isn’t about the athletic prowess of founders. Agile is an iterative method of establishing clear organizational tasks and requirements, continuously developing solutions, and making decisions quickly. Teams break up each of these factors into small digestible pieces, to keep the momentum going.

B2B2C
A mutually beneficial eCommerce business model where a company teams up with their business client, to then sell jointly to an end customer, controlling more of the transaction and increasing their visibility. Amazon is the most well-known example of this in the way that they receive product form manufacturers, to ship to the consumer, but may also be selling you product directly

Blind or Anonymous Applications
A process that removes identifying information (name, gender, company name, etc.) from the application in order to reduce bias. If there is little to no identifying information on a candidate or applicant, we make decisions that are free of bias and naturally result in diverse cohorts. We employ this method in our Launch Lane and Digital Health accelerators. TL:DR? It works.

Burn rate/runway
In its simplest form, how quickly your business is spending money that is already available. A high burn rate means you are spending cash quickly (burning through money quickly). And the runway is how much time you have before you burn through it all. There’s a fancy calculation for this, but make sure you are using your net burn rate to figure it out.

Business Advisor
Business Advisors provide guidance to companies (in our case, startups) in a variety of capacities. Business advisors might be investors, serial entrepreneurs, or seasoned experts in a specific field. The common theme is that they know a whole lot and can be hugely valuable to your early-stage company. If you are reading this, chances are you are not one (yet).

Churn rate
Now that you’ve familiarized yourself with burn rate, there’s a fancy calculation for this one too. Churn is the rate of customer attrition. Still too jargon-y? The rate at which a customer stops doing business with you, or the opposite of retention rate.

Commercialization
The process by which products or services are brought to the market. For example, the process by which mRNA research transitioned into a publicly available COVID-19 vaccine. We have an entire suite of programs to help companies and entrepreneurs along different stages of their journey and many of our convening and cultivation initiatives center around this key focus.

Customer discovery
Customer discovery doesn’t mean looking for customers, but rather identifying who the right customer is for your product while simultaneously finetuning your offering to suit their needs. At this stage you are testing assumptions and hypotheses to validate the customer you’ve identified and their “problem” or need.

    Product/market fit
    If you’ve done the work of customer discovery you may end up determining there is a big enough market or demand for your product or service. Or, you could end up deciding your idea or product is not worth pursuing further. 

E

Ecosystem
An ecosystem is an interconnected environment with diverse players and systems that support each other. We often define it by region, and we could frankly write a whole blog post just on this. As a first step, take a look at our ecosystem for a better idea of the resources we provide.

Exit
An exit is where founders have the opportunity to liquidate or reduce their stake or ownership in their business.

    Acquisition/Acquire
    A bigger fish comes along and offers to buy up most (more than 50%) or all of the company. At this point, they begin to call the shots and make the decisions.
    Acquihire
    When a company is acquired for its talent, skills or people.
    IPO or “Going Public”
    “Going Public” is when a privately held company (which startups typically are) becomes a publicly traded and owned entity, enabling it to gain cheaper access to capital, expand operations and diversify ownership. The IPO is the “Initial Public Offering” or the initial selling price for shares. The IPO gets the ball rolling on the whole process.
    Joint Venture
    Two separate companies join together to run or operate an already existing company or business.
    Merger
    Two companies mutually combine and blend, to create a new entity that benefits both parties.
    SPAC
    When a public "blank check" or shell company acquires a private company to take it public. It's a particular type of IPO that involves buying a company that's already listed but doesn't have an on-going business. It's technical, it's jargon-y, it's legal.

    Corporate VC (CVC)
    This investment is coming from within a corporation, and it could also include industry insights and connections. Beyond equity, the CVCs may be looking for a collaboration agreement or they may see your company as an acquisition target. Local examples includes Comcast Ventures, originally run by Julian Brodsky, Comcast’s co-founder and Touchdown Ventures, which runs outsourced CVCs for corporations, founded by Comcast Ventures alumni, David Horowitz.

    Follow-on funding
    A repeat investment from a funder who previously provided capital, now at a later stage in the business. For example, startups participating in the Science Center’s Commercialization programs raised over $43 million in follow-on funding in 2020.

    Pre/Post money valuation
    The value of a company before external investments or the latest round of funding/ the value of company after external investments or the latest round of funding.

    Priced Round
    This is an investment where the valuation of the company is determined as a negotiation between the company and the investor, and includes a price-per-share so it's clear how much of the company everyone owns.

    SAFE Note
    A non-debt convertible security. The “non-debt” part sounds safe, but let’s break that down even further. It will eventually convert into equity or something of value, in a future investment round (see Series A, B, C, D…below). Even simpler still: an investor is betting on the future potential of the company. SAFE notes exists as one option in a range of options between debt and a publicly traded stock price.
    Seed Funding
    The first official round of startup funding or equity funding (selling shares or ownership). Investors are involved here.
    Series A Funding
    The second stage of startup funding, but the first stage of venture capital financing. This comes before the B funding round.
    Series B Funding
    The second stage of venture capital financing. It sometimes features many of the same investors from the previous round, Series A, but may bring in additional prospects.
    Series C, D, etc.
    By the time a company reaches Series C funding, they may want to expand into another market (internationally, for example) or may be preparing themselves to go public or for an acquisition (i.e. an exit). For most companies, this is the final phase of funding.
    Venture Capitalists or VCs
    Private investors or investment firms that use money from pension plans, insurance companies, and wealthy people to place bets (capital) in exchange for equity in companies they believe have lots of growth potential, usually of (planned) unicorn proportions. Locally, the best example is none-other than First Round Capital, founded by Wharton alum, Josh Kopelman, and they have a pretty good sense of humor. 

In-kind support
Free support-- whether it’s space, equipment, human resources, creative skills, or professional services. For example, a university may donate lab space to a startup company as an in-kind donation.

Licensing
A business arrangement where a company sells the right to use their IP to another company to use its brand (trademark), copyrights, or a specific technology, usually patented or protected by trade secrets. These agreements are commonly used to pull technology out of TTO’s (see below).

LEAN
A strategy or methodology that focuses on creating the most value, using the least resources possible.

MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Sorry there are no trophies for this MVP. An MVP is a stripped-down version of the prototype with just the essential features and no bells and whistles. This allows the developers to save time while they validate a product idea and gather feedback on what to improve.
N

Non-technical founders
Like the name implies, you founded a tech or tech-enabled company, but do not code or build hardware. Maybe you’ve designed the business model, are leading first sales, or are overseeing operations. Non-technical founders might have a technical cofounder and will surround themselves with good tech talent to focus on the nitty gritty.

P

Pitch
How you present and sell your idea or product to investors. A good accelerator or business advisor will help you perfect this tirelessly, making sure you have a solid business plan to back it up. It is a choreographed performance. Check out our Startup Roundtable every Thursday at Venture Café Philadelphia to give you some guidance. It’s free and all are welcome!

    Elevator pitch
    A much shorter, condensed version of your regular pitch that you could effectively give to an investor during a short elevator ride. Keeping it simple is key here. At Venture Café Philadelphia, we once had attendees literally try this out, with investors from Robin Hood Ventures. In better forms, it will likely answer (nicely) “What do you do and why should we care?”

Proof-of-concept
Evidence that demonstrates the feasibility of your concept. Our QED Proof-of-Concept program helps bridge the gap between proof-of-concept and an effective business plan. It’s also what occurs when your MVP is validated.

Prototype
An early model of your product, built to test the concept. There are various types of prototypes, depending on what you are trying to test.

    Iteration
    The process of repetition to continuously improve. You’re going to continue testing and improving on your prototype, each time creating a different version. That will take time…and also funding. 


R&D Tax Credit
A federal income tax liability offset, used to stimulate startups and companies’ spending on research and development.

Revenue
The income generated by a company, usually through pilots, sales, or corporate partnerships. This does not include investments. A good rule of thumb is to aim to have as much of this as possible.
S

Scaling
This is the point where a company’s revenue is outpacing its costs substantially. At this stage, real growth can begin to happen because automating and ramping up production becomes more affordable. Our Launch Lane accelerator focuses on startups looking to reach this juncture.

Sweat equity
You need to raise capital, but you want to minimize the amount of debt you are saddled with. Founders and other employees contribute “sweat equity” (read blood, sweat and tears) as a share of the company with a monetary value, paid in equity in the company. Believe it or not, there is a way to calculate this.
T

Tech-enabled
These companies are not the same as “tech companies” because the product or service is powered by another already existing platform or technology (i.e. the internet). Companies that don’t create new technology, but leverage existing technology to provide a platform or service. Our Launch Lane accelerator is dedicated to growing tech and tech-enabled startups.

Technical Founder
This type of founder is building the product whereas non-technical founderstypically focus on business models, financial models, early sales, or overseeing operations.

The Valley of Death
The large gap in funding for early-stage startups or research. This is problematic for many startups and makes it challenging for success at an early stage-- it can deprive society of a potentially lifesaving or life changing innovation. 

Value proposition
You want customers and investors to show you the money. You’re gonna have to explain why they should choose your product. What’s special or different about you? This is your value prop.
