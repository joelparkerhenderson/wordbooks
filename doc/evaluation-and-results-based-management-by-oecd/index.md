<dl>

<dt>Accountability</dt>

<dd>

<p>Obligation to demonstrate that work has been conducted in compliance with agreed rules and standards or to report fairly and accurately on performance results vis a vis mandated roles and/or plans. This may require a careful, even legally defensible, demonstration that the work is consistent with the contract terms.</p>

<p>Note: Accountability in development may refer to the obligations of partners to
act according to clearly defined responsibilities, roles and performance expectations,
often with respect to the prudent use of resources. For evaluators, it connotes the
responsibility to provide accurate, fair and credible monitoring reports and performance
assessments. For public sector managers and policy-makers, accountability is to taxpayers/citizens.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Activity</dt>

<dd>

<p>Actions taken or work performed through which inputs, such as funds, technical assistance and other types of resources are mobilized to produce specific outputs.</p>

<p>Related term: development intervention.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Analytical tools</dt>

<dd>

<p>Methods used to process and interpret information during an evaluation.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Appraisal</dt>

<dd>

<p>An overall assessment of the relevance, feasibility and potential sustainability of a
development intervention prior to a decision of funding.</p>

<p>Note: In development agencies, banks, etc., the purpose of appraisal is to enable
decision-makers to decide whether the activity represents an appropriate use of corporate
resources.</p>

<p>Related term: ex-ante evaluation</p>

</dd>

<dt>Assumptions</dt>

<dd>

<p>Hypotheses about factors or risks which could affect the progress or success of a
development intervention.</p>

<p>Note: Assumptions can also be understood as hypothesized conditions that bear on the validity of the evaluation itself, e.g., about the characteristics of the population when designing a sampling procedure for a survey. Assumptions are made explicit in theory based evaluations where evaluation tracks systematically the anticipated results chain.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Attribution</dt>

<dd>

<p>The ascription of a causal link between observed (or expected to be observed) changes and a specific intervention.</p>

<p>Note: Attribution refers to that which is to be credited for the observed changes or results achieved. It represents the extent to which observed development effects can be attributed To a specific intervention or to the performance of one or more partner taking account of other interventions, (anticipated or unanticipated) confounding factors, or external shocks.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Audit</dt>

<dd>

<p>An independent, objective assurance activity designed to add value and improve an organization’s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to assess and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes.</p>

<p>Note: a distinction is made between regularity (financial) auditing, which focuses on
compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; and performance auditing, which
is concerned with relevance, econo-my, efficiency and effectiveness. Internal auditing
provides an assessment of internal controls undertaken by a unit reporting to management
while external auditing is conducted by an independent organization.</p>
