Natural languages are inherently complex and many NLP tasks are ill-posed for mathematically precise algorithmic solutions. With the advent of big data, data-driven approaches to NLP problems ushered in a new paradigm, where the complexity of the problem domain is effectively managed by using large datasets to build simple but high quality models.
