* [Non-functional requirements-- do we really care?](http://www.slideshare.net/osscube/non-functional-requirements-do-we-really-care)
* [What is a functional and non-functional requirement? - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16475979/what-is-functional-and-non-functional-requirement)

Examples of 
Execution qualities, such as security and usability, which are observable at run time.
Evolution qualities, such as testability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the software system.


<a name="ieee"><h2>IEEE Recommended Practice</h2></a>

Examples based on [IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications](http://www.utdallas.edu/~chung/RE/IEEE830-1993.pdf)

* Performance requirements
* Interface requirements
* Operational requirements
* Resource requirements
* Verification requirements
* Acceptance requirements
* Documentation requirements
* Security requirements
* Portability requirements
* Quality requirements
* Reliability requirements
* Maintainability requirements
* Safety requirements


<a name="users-and-developers"><h2>Users and developers</h2></a>

Users and developers typically want different kinds of quality attributes.

<table>
<tr><th>Important to users</th><th>Important to developers</th></tr>
<tr><td>Usability</td><td>Maintainability</td></tr>
<tr><td>Availability</td><td>Scalability</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reliability</td><td>Testability</td></tr>
</table>


<a name="subjective-and-objective"><h2>Subjective and objective</h2></a>

Examples of subjective attributes and objective attributes:

<table>
<tr><th>Subjective</th><th>Objective</th></tr>
<tr><td>Fast</td><td>Within 1 second</td></tr>
<tr><td>Easy</td><td>A majority of focus group users check the survey box "this is easy"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frequent</td><td>Every hour on the hour</td></tr>
<tr><td>Secure</td><td>All password storage uses scrypt encryption</td></tr>
<tr><td>Available</td><td>Our third-party monitoring service proves our uptime is 99% or higher</td></tr>
</table>
