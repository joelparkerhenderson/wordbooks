# RAID Log

A RAID log tracks:

* Risks
* Assumptions
* Issues
* Dependencies

Risks: 

  * Factors that can have an adverse impact on your project if they occur.

  * Risk refers to the combined likelihood the event will occur and the impact on the project if it does occur. 

  * If the likelihood of the event happening and impact to the project are both high, then you identify the event as a risk. 

  * The RAID log tracks each risk, including its description, an estimate of likelihood, an estimate of impact, a full analysis, and a mitigation plan.

Assumptions:

  * Factors that you are assuming to be in place that will contribute to the successful result of your project.

  * The RAID log tracks the assumption, the reason it is assumed, and the action needed to confirm whether the assumption is valid.

Issues: 

  * Factors that are going wrong on your project and needs managing; issues may result in a poor delivery or a failed delivery.

  * The RAID log tracks descriptions of each issue, its impact, its seriousness and actions needed to contain and remove it.

Dependencies:

  * Factors that are dependent on the result of your project, or on which your project is dependent. 

  * The RAID log tracks whom you are dependent on, what they should deliver and when, and who is dependent on you.
